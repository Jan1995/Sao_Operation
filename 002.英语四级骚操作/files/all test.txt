Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
The method for making beer has changed over time. Hops （啤酒花）, for example, which give many a modem beer its bitter flavor, are a __26__ recent addition to the beverage. This was first mentioned in reference to brewing in the ninth century. Now, researchers have found a __27__ ingredient in residue （残留物）from 5000-year-old beer brewing equipment. While digging two pits at a site in the central plains of China, scientists discovered fragments from pots and vessels. The different shapes of the containers __28__ they were used to brew, filter, and store beer. They may be ancient “beer-making tools”，and the earliest __29__ evidence of beer brewing in China, the researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To __30__ that theory, the team examined the yellowish, dried __31__ inside the vessels. The majority of the grains, about 80%, were from cereal crops like barley （大麦）and about 10% were bits of roots __32__ lily, which would have made the beer sweeter, the scientists say. Barley was an unexpected find: the crop was domesticated in Western Eurasia and didn’t become a __33__ food in central China until about 2,000 years ago, according to the researchers. Based on that timing, they indicate barley may have __34__ in the region not as food, but as __35__ material for beer brewing.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Team spirit
[A] Teams have become the basic building blocks of organisations. Recruitment advertisements routinely call for “team players' Business schools grade their students in part on their performance in group projects. Office managers knock down walls to encourage team building. Teams are as old as civilisation, of course: even Jesus had 12 co-workers. But a new report by Deloitte, “Global Human Capital Trends”，based on a survey of more than 7,000 executives in over 130 countries, suggests that the fashion for teamwork has reached a new high. Almost half of those surveyed said their companies were either in the middle of restructuring or about to embark on （开始）it; and for the most part, restructuring meant putting more emphasis on teams.
[B] Companies are abandoning conventional functional departments and organising employees into cross- disciplinary teams that focus on particular products, problems or customers. These teams are gaining more power to run their own affairs. They are also spending more time working with each other rather than reporting upwards. Deloitte argues that a new organisational form is on the rise: a network of teams is replacing the conventional hierarchy （等级体制）.
[C] The fashion for teams is driven by a sense that the old way of organising people is too rigid for both the modem marketplace and the expectations of employees. Technological innovation places greater value on agility （灵活性） John Chambers, chairman of Cisco Systems Inc., a worldwide leader in electronics products, says that “we compete against market transitions （过渡），not competitors. Product transitions used to take five or seven years; now they take one or two.” Digital technology also makes it easier for people to co-ordinate their activities without resorting to hierarchy. The “millennials” （千禧一代） who will soon make up half the workforce in rich countries were raised from nursery school onwards to work in groups.
[D] The fashion for teams is also spreading from the usual corporate suspects (such as GE and IBM) to some more unusual ones. The Cleveland Clinic, a hospital operator, has reorganised its medical staff into teams to focus on particular treatment areas; consultants, nurses and others collaborate closely instead of being separated by speciality （专业）and rank. The US Army has gone the same way. In his book, Team of Teams, General Stanley McChrystal describes how the army’s hierarchical structure hindered its operations during the early stages of the Iraq war. His solution was to learn something from the rebels it was fighting: decentralising authority to self-organising teams.
[E] A good rule of thumb is that as soon as generals and hospital administrators jump on a management bandwagon （追随一种管理潮流），it is time to ask questions. Leigh Thompson of Kellogg School of Management in Illinois warns that, “Teams are not always the answer—teams may provide insight, creativity and knowledge in a way that a person working independently cannot; but teamwork may also lead to confusion, delay and poor decision-making.” The late Richard Hackman of Harvard University once argued, “I have no question that when you have a team，the possibility exists that it will generate magic, producing something extraordinary... But don’t count on it.”
[F] Hackman (who died in 2013) noted that teams are hindered by problems of co-ordination and motivation that chip away at the benefits of collaboration. High-flyers （能干的人）who are forced to work in teams may be undervalued and free-riders empowered. Group-think may be unavoidable. In a study of 120 teams of senior executives, he discovered that less than 10% of their supposed members agreed on who exactly was on the team. If it is hard enough to define a team’s membership, agreeing on its purpose is harder still.
[G] Profound changes in the workforce are making teams trickier to manage. Teams work best if their members have a strong common culture. This is hard to achieve when, as is now the case in many big firms, a large proportion of staff are temporary contractors. Teamwork improves with time: America’s National Transportation Safety Board found that 73% of the incidents in its civil-aviation database occurred on a crew’s first day of flying together. However, as Amy Edmondson of Harvard points out, organisations increasingly use “team” as a verb rather than a noun: they form teams for specific purposes and then quickly disband them.
[H] The least that can be concluded from this research is that companies need to think harder about managing teams. They need to rid their minds of sentimentalism （感情用事）：the most successful teams have leaders who are able to set an overall direction and take immediate action. They need to keep teams small and focused: giving in to pressure to be more “inclusive” is a guarantee of dysfunction. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, says that “If I see more than two pizzas for lunch, the team is too big”. They need to immunise teams against group-think: Hackman argued that the best ones contain “deviants” （离经叛道者）who are willing to do something that may be upsetting to others.
[I] A new study of 12,000 workers in 17 countries by Steelcase, a furniture-maker which also does consulting, finds that the best way to ensure employees are “engaged” is to give them more control over where and how they do their work-which may mean liberating them from having to do everything in collaboration with others.
[J] However, organisations need to learn something bigger than how to manage teams better: they need to be in the habit of asking themselves whether teams are the best tools for the job. Team-building skills are in short supply: Deloitte reports that only 12% of the executives they contacted feel they understand the way people work together in networks and only 21% feel confident in their ability to build cross-functional teams. Loosely managed teams can become hotbeds of distraction employees routinely complain that they can’t get their work done because they are forced to spend too much time in meetings or compelled to work in noisy offices. Even in the age of open-plan offices and social networks some work is best left to the individual.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
Urbanization — migration away from the suburbs to the central city — will be the biggest real estate trend in 2015, according to a new report.
The report says America’s urbanization will continue to be the most significant issue affecting the industry, as cities across the country imitate the walkability and transit-oriented development making cities like New York and San Francisco so successful.
As smaller cities copy the model of these “24-hour cities”，more affordable versions of these places will be created. The report refers to this as the coming of the “18-hour city”，and uses the term to refer to cities like Houston, Austin, Charlotte, and Nashville, which are “positioning themselves as highly competitive, in terms of livability, employment offerings, and recreational and cultural amenities.”
Another trend that looks significant in 2015 is that America’s largest population group, Millennials （千禧一代），will continue to put off buying a house. Apartments will retain their appeal for a while for Millennials, haunted by what happened to home-owning parents.
This trend will continue into the 2020s, the report projects. After that, survey respondents disagree over whether this generation will follow in their parents’ footsteps, moving to the suburbs to raise families, or will choose to remain in the urban core. The survey projects that this population cohort will evolve and segment over time, and warns against painting the generation with too broad a brush.
Another issue affecting real estate in the coming year will be America’s failing infrastructure. Most roads, bridges, transit, water systems, the electric grid, and communications networks were installed 50 to 100 years ago, and they are largely taken for granted until they fail.
The report’s writers state that America’s failure to invest in infrastructure impacts not only the health of the real-estate market, but also our ability to remain globally competitive.
Apart from the specific trends highlighted above, which cause some investors to worry, the report portrays an overall optimism borne by the recent healthy real-estate “upcycle” and improving economy. Seventy-four percent of the respondents surveyed report a “good to excellent” expectation of real-estate profitability in 2015. While excessive optimism can promote bad investment patterns, resulting in a real- estate “bubble”，the report’s writers downplay that potential outcome in that it has not yet occurred.
Some respondents to the Emerging Markets survey call the urbanization trend “oversubscribed”，and the report concedes that there do exist some edge cities and suburbs with promise. But these places are few and far between. The most successful places are those built using urban-design principles — with density, walkability, and good transit.
Real-estate investors in 2015 need to pay attention to the two main conclusion of the report: if a property resembles or relies upon sprawl in any way, or doesn’t appeal to Millennials, think before you invest.
46. According to the new report, real estate development in 2015 will witness
A) an accelerating speed
B) a shift to city centers
C) a new focus on small cities
D) an ever-increasing demand

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
The brain is truly a marvel. A seemingly endless library, whose shelves house our most precious memories as well as our lifetime’s knowledge. But is there a point where it reaches capacity? In other words, can the brain be “full”？
The answer is a resounding no, because, well, brains are more sophisticated than that. A study published in Nature Neuroscience earlier this year shows that instead of just crowding in, old information is sometimes pushed out of the brain for new memories to form.
Previous behavioural studies have shown that learning new information can lead to forgetting. But in a new study, researchers demonstrated for the first time how this effect occurs in the brain.
In daily life, forgetting actually has clear advantages. Imagine, for instance, that you lost your bank card. The new card you receive will come with a new personal identification number (PIN). Each time you remember the new PIN, you gradually forget the old one. This process improves access to relevant information, without old memories interfering.
And most of us will be able to identify with the frustration of having old memories interfere with new, relevant memories. Consider trying to remember where you parked your car in the same car park you were at a week earlier. This type of memory (where you are trying to remember new, but similar information) is particularly susceptible to interference.
When we acquire new information, the brain automatically tries to incorporate it within existing information by forming associations. And when we retrieve information, both the desired and associated but irrelevant information is recalled.
The majority of previous research has focused on how we learn and remember new information. But current studies are beginning to place greater emphasis on the conditions under which we forget, as its importance begins to be more appreciated.
A very small number of people are able to remember almost every detail of their life. While it may sound like an advantage to many, people with this rare condition often find their unusual ability burdensome.
Some report an inability to think about the present or the future, because of the feeling of constantly living in the past, caught in their memories. And this is what we all might experience if our brains didn’t have a mechanism for superseding information that’s no longer relevant and did indeed fill up.
At the other end of the spectrum is a phenomenon called “accelerated long-term forgetting”，which has been observed in epilepsy and stroke patients. As the name suggests, these people forget newly learnt information at a much faster rate, sometimes within a few hours, compared to what’s considered normal.
It’s believed this represents a failure to “consolidate” or transfer new memories into long-term memory. But the processes and impact of this form of forgetting are still largely unexplored.
In a sense，forgetting is our brain’s way of sorting memories, so the most relevant memories are ready for retrieval. Normal forgetting may even be a safety mechanism to ensure our brain doesn’t become too full.
51.What have past behavioural studies found about our brain?
A) Its capacity actually knows no limits.
B) It grows sophisticated with practice.
C) It keeps our most precious memories until life’s end.
D) New information learned pushes old information out.
【答案】D
【解析】根据题干中的关键词past behavioural studies可定位至第三段。
52. What is the benefit of forgetting?
A) It frees us from painful memories.
B) It helps slow down our aging process.
C) It facilitates our access to relevant information.
D) It prevents old information from forming associations.
【答案】C
【解析】本题定位至第四段。
53. What is the emphasis of current studies of memory?
A) When people tend to forget.
B) What contributes to forgetting.
C) How new technology hinders memory capacity.
D) Why learning and forgetting are complementary.
【答案】B
【解析】根据题干中的关键词emphasis和current studies可定位至第七段。
54. What do people find about their rare ability to remember every detail of their life?
A) It adds to the burden of their memory.
B) It makes their life more complicated.
C) It contributes to their success in life.
D)It constitutes a rare object of envy.
【答案】A
【解析】根据题干中的关键词every detail of their life可定位至第八段。
55.What does the passage say about forgetting?
A) It can enlarge our brain capacity.
B) It helps get rid of negative memories.
C) It is a way of organizing our memories.
D) It should not cause any alarm in any way.
【答案】C
【解析】本题定位至最后一段。

听力原文：
Automakers and tech companies are working hard to offer the first true self-driving car, but 75% of drivers say they wouldn’t feel safe in such a vehicle. Still, 60% of drivers would like to get some kind of self-driving feature such as automatic braking or self-parking the next time they buy a new car. The attitudes are published in a new AAA survey of 1,800 drivers. Advocates of self- driving cars argue they would be safer than in cars driven by humans because they wouldn’t get distracted or drive when tired. (1) But those surveyed by AAA say they trust their own driving skills. Many feel the technology is too new and unproven. (2) John Nielsen, AAA’s managing director of automotive engineering and repair, said tests suggest drivers may be overestimating their own abilities. He also believes they will be more likely to trust self-driving cars as they become more familiar with features such as automatic braking or parking. He estimated that the “comfort lever” will increase considerably in five to ten years.

M: That’s fantastic!
W: (9) The work is just helping out with data input. You know, but the pay isn’t too bad. It might suit you too. I know they have at least two temporary positions available. And I don’t think they have anyone else yet.
M: Um, if they take you on, tell them you know a friend who’d be really good too. (10) I really need the money and the experience will look good on my resume. Maybe we’ll be working together. The dream team!
W: Ok, we’ll do. If the boss likes me, I’ll mention it. It will be good to have someone around who I know. I’ll phone you afterwards. But perhaps you should put in an application anyway.
M: Thanks Susan, that’s great. Listen, do you want a lift to the city? I have my dad’s car today and nothing else to do this morning.
W: Sure, thanks James.
M: Let’s go then. The car is over there.
W: By the way, how is your knowledge of accountancy? The interviewer may ask you about it.

Conversation Two
W: There is new data out today that confirms that many Americans are not good at Math. And when it comes to everyday technology skills, we are dead last when compared to other developed countries. Here’s Gabriel Emanuel of National Public Radio.
M: (12)/(14) Let’s start with the bad news that Americans are terrible at technology skills, using email, naming the file on a computer, using the link on a webpage or just texting someone.
W: No country scored below the U.S.?
M: Only one country. (13) Poland performed as poorly as we did. Who came out the first? Japan did the best, and then Finland.(14)If you look at data about reading and Math, you’ll notice something interesting. Younger adults who went to college or graduate school were doing pretty well. In literacy, they were actually doing better than their peers in other countries.
W: So that’s a bit of good news.
M: (15) But when you look at Americans who have a high school diploma, they look a lot like other countries’ high school dropouts. We have a lot of work to do. That is especially true, when it comes to Math. You go to the store and there is a sale. Buy one, get the second one half off. You decide to buy two. How much do you pay?
W: You mean high school graduates can’t do this task in general?
M: You are right. What does that tell us about our education system? Well, it tells us that we need to think about the preparedness of our students, as they are leaving high school.
W: Right, and schools, employers in fact we all need to do something about it. Thank you, Gabriel.

【答案】B
【解析】听力材料在提及两次世界大战时说道“carrots got their biggest boost during the two world wars when food shortages forced people to eat them”，由此可知选B。
听力原文：
(16) Wild carrots probably evolved with the other flowering plants about 360 million years ago. Like apples, carrots are native to Central Asia. That’s why horses, which also come from Central Asia, like both apples and carrots so much.
(16) With wild carrots, the roots are white, small and skinny, so you’d have to pick a lot of wild carrots to get enough to eat. Doctors used carrot seeds and roots as medicine on the theory that foods that taste bad must be good for you.
Around 800 AD, people in Central Asia managed to develop a new kind of carrot—a purple carrot that attracted more interest from international traders. (17) Then in the late 1500s, food scientists in the Netherlands cultivated large, straight, sweet, red carrots like the ones we eat today. But people still mostly fed carrots to horses, donkeys and pigs, and didn’t eat them themselves.
In the 1600s, people in China used carrots as medicine, but they also ate carrots boiled in soup. The red color was popular for Chinese New Year celebrations. (18) But carrots got their biggest boost during the two world wars when food shortages forced people to eat them, and governments told everyone how healthy carrots were; Today, cooler countries grow most of the world’s carrots. Machines do most of the planting and picking, and carrots are easy to store and ship, so they are cheap almost everywhere.

听力原文：
Katherine loved Facebook. With Facebook, she could stay connected with her family no matter how far away they were. She could see their photos and read their status updates. With Facebook, she could keep her relatives up to date on what she was doing.
(19) Another thing Katherine loved about Facebook was that she didn’t have to think about time zones when updating family. Whenever she called her parents or other relatives, she always had to think about the time difference so that she wouldn’t wake someone up or call when she knew they were in church. (19) Facebook was so convenient.
When Catherine joined Facebook, some of her classmates at high school started to add her as a friend. (20) At first, this didn’t bother her. She loved learning about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. She loved finding out people were getting married, having babies and travelling. (21) Soon however, Katherine found herself comparing herself with the people she was reading about on Facebook. It began to make her feel bad that some people seem to be doing so much better than she was. She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone’s status updates. Katherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and realized some of them were not really friends at all.

听力原文：
Do you know where a mule comes from? It is the child of a donkey and a horse. (22) Mules have strong muscles like horses but they eat less, can work longer, and are gentler like donkeys. George Washington was the first person in the United States to own mules. He had heard that mules made good farm animals and he contacted the U.S. ambassador in Spain to ask about them. (23) In 1785, King Charles III of Spain sent Washington a male donkey as a gift. That male donkey became the father of the mule industry in the U.S.
Every April, Maury County holds a Mule Day celebration. (24) Held in Columbia, Tennessee, Mule Day had its beginnings as “Breeder’s Day” in the 1840s. Farmers and farm animal breeders would bring their animals to market every April to show, buy and trade. This was an important business before the days of tractors when many families made a living from farming, and mules were used as work animals. (25) Eventually, tractors began to replace mules, making them less in demand.
A parade was added to Mule Day in 1934 to attract more people. Over the years, other activities have been added. And today more than 200,000 people show up each year to watch and participate. If you visit during Mule Day celebrations, you might see mule-driving contests, square dances, horn shows, or even tree cutting competitions.

Answer the question by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The Blessing and Curse of the People Who Never Forget
A handful of people can recall almost every day of their lives in enormous detail-and after years of research, neuroscientists are finally beginning to understand how they do it.
[A] For most of us, memory is a mess of blurred and faded pictures of our lives. As much as we would like to cling on to our past, even the saddest moments can be washed away with time.
[B] Ask Nima Veiseh what he was doing for any day in the past 15 years, however, and he will give you the details of the weather, what he was wearing, or even what side of the train he was sitting on his journey to work. “My memory is like 汪 library of video tapes, walk-throughs of every day of my life from waking to sleeping,” he explains.
[C] Veiseh can even put a date on when those tapes started recording: 15 December 2000, when he met his first girlfriend at his best friend’s 16th birthday party. He had always had a good memory, but the thrill of young love seems to have shifted a gear in his mind: from now on, he would start recording his whole life in detail. “I could tell you everything about every day after that.”
[D] Needless to say, people like Veiseh are of great interest to neuroscientists （神经科学专家）hoping to understand the way the brain records our lives. A couple of recent papers have finally opened a window on these people’s extraordinary minds. And such research might even suggest ways for us all to relive our past with greater clarity.
[E] “Highly superior autobiographical memory” (or HSAM for short), first came to light in the early 2000s, with a young woman named Jill Price. Emailing the neuroscientist and memory researcher Jim McGaugh one day, she claimed that she could recall every day of her life since the age of 12. Could he help explain her experiences?
[F] McGaugh invited her to his lab, and began to test her: he would give her a date and ask her to tell him about the world events on that day. True to her word, she was correct almost every time.
[G] It didn’t take long for magazines and documentary film-makers to come to understand her “total recall” , and thanks to the subsequent media interest, a few dozen other subjects (including Veiseh) have since come forward and contacted the team at the University of California, Irvine.
[H] Interestingly, their memories are highly self-centred: although they can remember “autobiographical” life events in extraordinary detail, they seem to be no better than average at recalling impersonal information, such as random （任意选取的）lists of words. Nor are they necessarily better at remembering a round of drinks, say. And although their memories are vast, they are still likely to suffer from “false memories' Clearly, there is no such thing as a “perfect” memory~~their extraordinary minds are still using the same flawed tools that the rest of us rely on. The question is, how?
[I] Lawrence Patihis at the University of Southern Mississippi recently studied around 20 people with HSAM and found that they scored particularly high on two measures: fantasy proneness （倾向）and absorption. Fantasy proneness could be considered a tendency to imagine and daydream, whereas absorption is the tendency to allow your mind to become fully absorbed in an activity to pay complete attention to the sensations (感受)and the experiences. “I’m extremely sensitive to sounds, smells and visual detail,” explains Nicole Donohue, who has taken part in many of these studies. “I definitely feel things more strongly than the average person.”
[J] The absorption helps them to establish strong foundations for recollection, says Patihis, and the fantasy proneness means that they revisit those memories again and again in the coming weeks and months. Each time this initial memory trace is “replayed”，it becomes even stronger. In some ways, you probably go through that process after a big event like your wedding day but the difference is that thanks to their other psychological tendencies, the HSAM subjects are doing it day in, day out, for the whole of their lives.
[K] Not everyone with a tendency to fantasise will develop HSAM, though, so Patihis suggests that something must have caused them to think so much about their past. “Maybe some experience in their childhood meant that they became obsessed (着迷）with calendars and what happened to them,” says Patihis.
[L] The people with HSAM Fve interviewed would certainly agree that it can be a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it allows you to relive the most transformative and enriching experiences. Veiseh, for instance, travelled a lot in his youth. In his spare time, he visited the local art galleries, and the paintings are now lodged deep in his autobiographical memories.
[M] “Imagine being able to remember every painting, on every wall, in every gallery space, between nearly 40 countries,” he says. “That’s a big education in art by itself.” With this comprehensive knowledge of the history of art, he has since become a professional painter.
[N] Donohue, now a history teacher, agrees that it helped during certain parts of her education: “I can definitely remember what I learned on certain days at school. I could imagine what the teacher was saying or what it looked like in the book.”
[O] Not everyone with HSAM has experienced these benefits, however. Viewing the past in high definition can make it very difficult to get over pain and regret. “It can be very hard to forget embarrassing moments,” says Donohue. “You feel the same emotions—it is just as raw, just as fresh… ou can’t turn off that stream of memories, no matter how hard you try.” Veiseh agrees: “It is like having these open wounds they are just a part of you,” he says.
[P] This means they often have to make a special effort to lay the past to rest. Bill, for instance, often gets painful “flashbacks”, in which unwanted memories intrude into his consciousness, but overall he has chosen to see it as the best way of avoiding repeating the same mistakes. “Some people are absorbed in the past but not open to new memories, but that’s not the case for me. I look forward to each day and experiencing something new.”

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
The phrase almost completes itself: midlife crisis. It’s the stage in the middle of the journey when people feel youth vanishing, their prospects narrowing and death approaching.
There’s only one problem with the cliche （套话）. It isn’t true.
“In fact, there is almost no hard evidence for midlife crisis other than a few small pilot studies conducted decades ago,” Barbara Hagerty writes in her new book, Life Reimagined. The bulk of the research shows that there may be a pause, or a shifting of gears in the 40s or 50s, but this shift “can be exciting, rather than terrifying.”
Barbara Hagerty looks at some of the features of people who turn midlife into a rebirth. They break routines, because “autopilot is death.” They choose purpose over happiness—having a clear sense of purpose even reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They give priority to relationships, as careers often recede （逐渐淡化）.
Life Reimagined paints a picture of middle age that is far from gloomy. Midlife seems like the second big phase of decision-making. Your identity has been formed; you’ve built up your resources; and now you have the chance to take the big risks precisely because your foundation is already secure.
Karl Barth described midlife precisely this way. At middle age, he wrote, “the sowing is behind; now is the time to reap. The run has been taken; now is the time to leap. Preparation has been made; now is the time for the venture of the work itself.”
The middle-aged person, Barth continued, can see death in the distance, but moves with a “measured haste” to get big new things done while there is still time.
What Barth wrote decades ago is even truer today. People are healthy and energetic longer. We have presidential candidates running for their first term in office at age 68, 69 and 74. A longer lifespan is changing the narrative structure of life itself. What could have been considered the beginning of a decent is now a potential turning point the turning point you are most equipped to take full advantage of.
46. What does the author think of the phrase “midlife crisis”？
A) It has led to a lot of debate.
B) It is widely acknowledged.
C) It is no longer fashionable.
D) It misrepresents real life.
【答案】D

D) It may see old-age disease approaching.
【答案】B
【解析】根据题干中的关键词Barbara Hagerty可定位至第三、四段。
48. How is midlife pictured in the book Life Reimagined?
A) It can be quite rosy.
B) It can be burdensome.
C) It undergoes radical transformation.
D) It makes for the best part of one’s life.
【答案】A

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
In spring, chickens start laying again, bringing a welcome source of protein at winter’s end. So it’s no surprise that cultures around the world celebrate spring by honoring the egg.
Some traditions are simple, like the red eggs that get baked into Greek Easter breads. Others elevate the egg into a fancy art, like the heavily jewel-covered “eggs” that were favored by the Russians starting in the 19th century.
One ancient form of egg art comes to us from Ukraine. For centuries, Ukrainians have been drawing complicated patterns on eggs. Contemporary artists have followed this tradition to create eggs that speak to the anxieties of our age: Life is precious, and delicate. Eggs are, too.
“There’s something about their delicate nature that appeals to me,” says New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast. Several years ago, she became interested in eggs and learned the traditional Ukrainian technique to draw her very modem characters. “I’ve broken eggs at every stage of the process 一 from the very beginning to the very, very end.”
But there’s an appeal in that vulnerability. “There’s part of this sickening horror of knowing you’re walking on the edge with this, that I kind of like, knowing that it could all fall apart at any second.” Chast’s designs, such as a worried man alone in a tiny rowboat, reflect that delicateness.
Traditional Ukrainian decorated eggs also spoke to those fears. The elaborate patterns were believed to offer protection against evil.
“There’s an ancient legend that as long as these eggs are made, evil will not prevail in the world,” says Joan Brander, a Canadian egg-painter who has been painting eggs for over 60 years, having learned the art from her Ukrainian relatives.
The tradition, dating back to 300 B.C., was later incorporated into the Christian church. The old symbols, however, still endure. A decorated egg with a bird on it, given to a young married couple, is a wish for children. A decorated egg thrown into the field would be a wish for a good harvest.
51. Why do people in many cultures prize the egg?
A) It is a welcome sign of the coming of spring.
B) It is their major source of protein in winter.
C) It can easily be made into a work of art.
D) It can bring wealth and honor to them.
【答案】A
【解析】根据本题的关键词prize the egg可定位至第一段。
52. What do we learn about the decorated “eggs” in Russia?
A) They are shaped like jewel cases.
B) They are cherished by the rich.
C) They are heavily painted in red.
D) They are favored as a form of art.
【答案】D
【解析】根据本题的关键词Russia可定位至第二段。
53. Why have contemporary artists continued the egg art tradition?
A) Eggs serve as an enduring symbol of new life.
B) Eggs have an oval shape appealing to artists.
C) Eggs reflect the anxieties of people today.
D) Eggs provide a unique surface to paint on.
【答案】C
【解析】根据本题的关键词contemporary artists和tradition可定位至第三段。
54. Why does Chast enjoy the process of decorating eggs?
A) She never knows if the egg will break before the design is completed.
B) She can add multiple details to the design to communicate her idea.
C) She always derives great pleasure from designing something new.
D) She is never sure what the final design will look like until the end.
【答案】A
【解析】本题定位至第五段。
55. What do we learn from the passage about egg-painting?
A) It originated in the eastern part of Europe.
B) It has a history of over two thousand years.
C) It is the most time-honored form of fancy art.
D) It is especially favored as a church decoration.

听力原文：
Dogs, man's best friends, have a clear strategy for dealing with angry owners—they look away.
New research shows that dogs limit their eye contact with angry humans. The scientists suggest this may be an attempt to calm humans down. This behavior may have evolved as dogs gradually learned they could benefit from avoiding conflicts with humans.
To conduct the tests, the University of Helsinki researchers trained 31 dogs to rest in front of a video screen. Facial photos of dogs and humans were
displayed on the screen for 1.5 seconds. They showed threatening, pleasant and neutral expressions. Nearby cameras tracked the dogs' eye movements.
Dogs in the study looked most at the eyes of humans and other dogs to sense their emotions. When dogs looked at expressions of angry dogs, their eyes rested more on the mouth, perhaps to interpret the threatening expressions. And when looking at angry humans, they tended to turn away their gaze.
Dogs may have learned to detect threat signs from
humans and respond by trying to make peace, according to researcher Sanni Somppi. Avoiding conflicts may have helped dogs develop better bonds with humans.
The researchers also note that dogs scan faces as a whole to sense how people are feeling, instead of focusing on a given feature. They suggest this indicates that dogs aren't sensing emotions from a single feature, but piecing together information from all facial features just as humans do.

听力原文：
Winter in many places is very cold. There is lots of snow around, and the ground freezes, which can make life difficult for animals. People in cold places live in warm houses and have learned to adapt. What do animals do? There are three main ways that animals survive the cold in winter: sleep, adapt or migrate.
Some animals, such as bears, frogs and snakes, sleep all winter. They sleep very deeply and need little or no food. While sleeping, their body temperature drops, and their heart beat slows down. To prepare for this before
winter, these animals eat extra food to become fat, which gives them the energy they need while they sleep.
Other animals adapt. For example, by staying active in winter. It is often hard for them to find food. So some animals, such as mice, collect extra food before winter, and hide it. When winter comes, they return to their hiding places to eat the food. Some animals grow thicker fur, or live in tree holes or underground to stay warm. Some birds migrate by flying to a warmer place for the winter, where they can find more food.
Some fly very long distances, including one kind of bird that flies from the remote north of the world, all the way to the distant south. Some birds fly in groups for safety, while others fly alone.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
As if you needed another reason to hate the gym, it now turns out that exercise can exhaust not only your muscles, but also your eyes. Fear not, however, for coffee can stimulate them again. During 26 exercise, our muscles tire as they run out of fuel and build up waste products. Muscle performance can also be affected by a __27__ called “central fatigue”,in which an imbalance in the body’s chemical messengers prevents the central nervous system from directing muscle movements __28__ . It was not known, however, whether central fatigue might also affect motor systems not directly __29__ in the exercise itself, such as those that move the eyes. To find out, researchers gave 11 volunteer cyclists a carbohydrate (碳水化合物) __30__ either with a moderate dose of caffeine (咖徘因),which is known to stimulate the central nervous system, or as a placebo (安慰剂)without, during 3 hours of __31 __ . After exercising, the scientists tested the cyclists with eye-tracking cameras to see how well their brains could still __32__ their visual system. The team found that exercise reduced the speed of rapid eye movements by about 8%, __33__ their ability to capture new visual information. The caffeine, the equivalent of two strong cups of coffee, was __34__ to reverse this effect, with some cyclists even displaying __35__ eye movement speeds. So it might be a good idea to get someone else to drive you home after that marathon.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the question by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
[A] At some point, almost all of us will experience a period of radical professional change. Some of us will seek it out: for others it will feel like an unwelcome intrusion into otherwise stable careers. Either way, we have choices about how we respond to it when it comes.
[B] We recently caught up with yoga entrepreneur Leah Zaccaria, who put herself through the fire of change to completely reinvent herself. In her search to live a life of purpose, Leah left her high-paying accounting job, her husband, and her home. In the process, she built a radically new life and career. Since then, she has founded two yoga studios, met a new life partner, and formed a new community of people. Even if your personal reinvention is less drastic, we think there are lessons from her experience that apply.
[C] Where do the seeds of change come from? The Native American Indians have a saying: “Pay attention to the whispers so you won’t have to hear the screams.” Often the best ideas for big changes come from unexpected places — it’s just a matter of tuning in. Great leaders recognize the weak signals or slight signs that point to big changes to come. Leah reflects on a time she listened to the whispers: “About the time my daughter was five years old. I started having a sense that ‘this isn’t right’.” She then realized that her life no longer matched her vision for it.
[D] Up until that point, Leah had followed traditional measures of success. After graduating with a degree in business and accounting, she joined a public accounting firm, married, bought a house, put lots of stuff in it, and had a baby. “I did what everybody else thought looked successful, she says. Leah easily could have fallen into a trap of feeling content, instead, her energy sparked a period of experimentation and renewal.
[E] Feeling the need to change, Leah started playing with future possibilities by exploring her interests and developing new capabilities. First trying physical exercise and dieting. She lost some weight and discovered an inner strength. “ I felt powerful because I broke through my own limitations” , she recalls.
[F] However, it was another interest that led Leah to radically reinvent herself. “ I remember sitting on a bench with my aunt at a yoga studio, ” she said, “ and having a moment of clarity right then and there. Yoga is saving my life. Yoga is waking me up. I,m not happy and I want to change and I,m done with this.” In that moment of clarity Leah made an important leap, conquering her inner resistance to change and making a firm commitment to take bigger steps.
[G] Creating the future you want is a lot easier if you are ready to exploit the opportunities that come your way. When Leah made the commitment to change, she primed herself to new opportunities she may otherwise have overlooked. She recalls:
[H] One day a man I worked with, Ryan, who had his office next to mine, said, “Leah, let’s go look at this space on Queen Anne.” He knew my love for yoga and had seen a space close to where he lived that he thought might be good to serve as a yoga studio. As soon as I saw the location, I knew this was it. Of course I was scared, yet I had this strong sense of “I have to do this.” Only a few months later Leah opened her first yoga studio, but success was not instant.
[I] Creating the future takes time. That’s why leaders continue to manage the present while building toward the big nonlinear changes of the future. When it’s time to make the leap, they take action and decisively drop what’s no longer serving their purpose. Initially Leah stayed with her accounting job while starting up the yoga studio to make it all work. “I was working 60 hours a week and running a studio, so I wasn’t getting very much sleep, but it was good for me,” she says. Soon after, she knew she had to make a bold move to fully commit to her new future. Within two years, Leah shed the safety of her accounting job and made the switch complete. Such drastic change is not easy.
[J] “Be yourself”, Leah says. “Quit being the person people think you’re supposed to be. Find a way to dig deep into your courageous self to be who you are. Whatever that means as far as exploring your emotions, your identity, your profession, find one version of you that you are always and everywhere.” It was this sense of purpose that would carry Leah through the storms of change.
[K] Steering through change and facing obstacles brings us face to face with our fears. Leah reflects on one incident that triggered her fears, when her investors threatened to shut her down: “I was probably up against the most fear I’ve ever had,” she says. “I had spent two years cultivating this community, and it had become successful very fast, but within six months I was facing the prospect of losing it all.”
[L] She connected with her sense of purpose and dug deep, cultivating a tremendous sense of strength. “I was feeling so intentional and strong that I wasn’t going to let fear just take over. I was thinking, ‘OK, guys, if you want to try to shut me down, shut me down.’ And I knew it was a negotiation scheme, so I was able to say to myself, ‘This is not real.’” By naming her fears.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
Shoppers in the UK are spending less money on toilet paper to save money, research has shown.
Penny-pinching UK consumers choose cheaper products from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl rather than luxury alternatives.
This has wiped 6% off the value of the soft tissue paper market in the UK. It has shrunk from £1.19 billion in 2011 to £1.12 billion in 2015, according to a new report from market research company Mintel. Furthermore, the future of the market looks far from rosy, with sales expected to fall further to £1.11 billion in 2016.
In the last year alone, despite an increase in the UK population and a subsequent rise in the number of households, sales of toilet paper fell by 2%, with the average household reducing their toilet roll spending from £43 in 2014 to £41 in 2015.
Overall, almost three in five people say they try to limit their usage of paper including facial tissue and kitchen roll—to save money. “Strength, softness and thickness remain the leading indicators of toilet paper quality, with just a small proportion of consumers preferring more luxurious alternatives, such as those with flower patterns or perfume, said Mintel analyst Jack Duckett. “These extra features are deemed unnecessary by the majority of shoppers, which probably reflects how these types of products are typically more expensive than regular toilet paper, even when on special offer.”
While consumers are spending less on toilet paper, they remain fussy in theory at least when it comes to paper quality. Top of Britons,toilet paper wish list is softness (57%) followed by strength (45%) and thickness (36%).
One in 10 buyers rank toilet rolls made from recycled paper among their top considerations, highlighting how overall the environment is much less of a consideration for shoppers than product quality. In a challenge for manufacturers, 81% of paper product users said they would consider buying recycled toilet tissue if it were comparable in quality to standard paper.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
“One of the reasons I find this topic very interesting is because my mom was a smoker when I was younger,” says Lindson-Hawley, who studies tobacco and health at the University of Oxford.
By studying about 700 adult smokers, she found out that her mom quit the right way—by stopping abruptly and completely.
In her study, participants were randomly (随机地)assigned to two groups. One had to quit abruptly on a given day, going from about a pack a day to zero. The other cut down gradually over the course of two weeks. People in both groups used nicotine(尼古丁)patches before they quit, in addition to a second form of nicotine replacement, like gum or spray. They also had talk therapy with a nurse before and after quit day.
Six months out, more people who had quit abruptly had stuck with it—more than one-fifth of them, compared to about one-seventh in the other group. Although these numbers appear low, it is much higher than if people try without support.
And the quit rates were particularly convincing given that before the study started, most of the people had said they’d rather cut down gradually before quitting. “If you’re training for a marathon, you wouldn’t expect to turn up and just be able to run it. And I think people see that for smoking as well. They think, ‘ Well, if I gradually reduce, it’s like practice,’” says Lindson-Hawley. But that wasn’t the case. Instead of giving people practice, the gradual reduction likely gave them cravings (痛)and withdrawal symptoms before they even reached quit day, which could be why fewer people in that group actually made it to that point. “Regardless of your stated preference, if you’re ready to quit, quitting abruptly is more effective,” says Dr. Gabriela Ferreira. “When you can quote a specific number like a fifth of the patients were able to quit, that’s compelling. It gives them the encouragement, I think, to really go for it,” Ferreira says.
People rarely manage to quit the first time they try. But at least, she says, they can maximize the odds of success.
51. What does Lindson-Hawley say about her mother?
A)She quit smoking with her daughter’s help.
B)She succeeded in quitting smoking abruptly.
C)She was also a researcher of tobacco and health.
D)She studied the smoking patterns of adult smokers.
【答案】B
【解析】由“By studying about 700 adult smokers, she found out that her mom quit the right way—by stopping abruptly and completely. 可知，答案为B。
52. What kind of support did smokers receive to quit smoking in Lindson-Hawley’s study?
A)They were given physical training.
B)They were looked after by physicians.
C)They were encouraged by psychologists.
D)They were offered nicotine replacements.
【答案】D
【解析】由“People in both groups used nicotine patches before they quit, in addition to a second form of nicotine replacement, like gum or spray.”可知。答案为D。
53. How does Dr. Gabriela Ferreira view the result of Lindson-Hawley’s experiment?
A)It is idealized. B) It is unexpected.
C) It is encouraging. D) It is misleading.

　　Small Schools Rising
　　This year's list of the top 100 high schools shows that today, those with fewer students are flourishing.
　　Fifty years ago, they were the latest thing in educational reform: big, modern, suburban high schools with students counted in the thousands. As baby boomers(二战后婴儿潮时期出生的人) came of high-school age, big schools promised economic efficiency. A greater choice of courses, and, of course, better football teams. Only years later did we understand the trade-offs this involved: the creation of excessive bureaucracies(官僚机构)，the difficulty of forging personal connections between teachers and students.SAT scores began dropping in 1963;today,on average,30% of students do not complete high school in four years, a figure that rises to 50% in poor urban neighborhoods. While the emphasis on teaching to higher, test-driven standards as set in No Child Left Behind resulted in significantly better performance in elementary(and some middle)schools, high schools for a variety of reasons seemed to have made little progress.
　　Size isn't everything, but it does matter, and the past decade has seen a noticeable countertrend toward smaller schools. This has been due ,in part ,to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $1.8 billion in American high schools, helping to open about 1,000 small schools-most of them with about 400 kids each with an average enrollment of only 150 per grade, About 500 more are on the drawing board. Districts all over the country are taking notice, along with mayors in cities like New York, Chicago and San Diego. The movement includes independent public charter schools, such as No.1 BASIS in Tucson, with only 120 high-schoolers and 18 graduates this year. It embraces district-sanctioned magnet schools, such as the Talented and Gifted School, with 198 students, and the Science and Engineering Magnet,with383,which share a building in Dallas, as well as the City Honors School in Buffalo, N.Y., which grew out of volunteer  evening seminars for students. And it includes alternative schools with students selected by lottery(抽签)，such as H-B Woodlawn in Arlington, Va. And most noticeable of all, there is the phenomenon of large urban and suburban high schools that have split up into smaller units of a few hundred, generally housed in the same grounds that once boasted thousands of students all marching to the same band.
　　Hillsdale High School in San Mateo, Calif, is one of those, ranking No.423-among the top 2% in the country-on Newsweek's annual ranking of America's top high schools. The success of small schools is apparent in the listings. Ten years ago, when the first Newsweek list based on college-level test participation was published, only three of the top 100 schools had graduating Classes smaller than 100 students. This year there are 22. Nearly 250 schools on the full ,Newsweek list of the top 5% of schools nationally had fewer than 200 graduates in 2007.
　　Although many of Hillsdale's students came from wealthy households, by the late 1990 average test scores were sliding and it had earned the unaffectionate nickname (绰号) "Hillsjail. " Jeff Gilbert. A Hillsdale teacher who became principal last year, remembers sitting with other teachers watching students file out of a graduation ceremony and asking one another in astonishment, "How did that student graduate?"
　　So in 2003 Hillsdale remade itself into three "houses," romantically named Florence, Marrakech and Kyoto. Each of the 300 arriving ninth graders are randomly(随机地) assigned to one of the houses. Where they will keep the same four core subject teachers for two years, before moving on to another for 11th and 12th grades. The closeness this system cultivates is reinforced by the institution of "advisory" classes Teachers meet with students in groups of 25, five mornings a week, for open-ended discussions of everything from homework problems to bad Saturday-night dates. The advisers also meet with students privately and stay in touch with parents, so they are deeply invested in the students' success."We're constantly talking about one another's advisers," says English teacher Chris Crockett. "If you hear that yours isn't doing well in math, or see them sitting outside the dean's office, it's like a personal failure." Along with the new structure came a more demanding academic program, the percentage of freshmen taking biology jumped from 17 to 95."It was rough for some. But by senior year, two-thirds have moved up to physics," says Gilbert "Our kids are coming to school in part because they know there are adults here who know them and care for them."But not all schools show advances after downsizing, and it remains to be seen whether smaller schools will be a cure-all solution.
　　The Newsweek list of top U.S. high schools was made this year, as in years past, according to a single metric, the proportion of students taking college-level exams. Over the years this system has come in for its share of criticism for its simplicity. But that is also its strength: it's easy for readers to understand, and to do the arithmetic for their own schools if they'd like.
　　Ranking schools is always controversial, and this year a group of 38 superintendents(地区教育主管)from five states wrote to ask that their schools be excluded from the calculation."It is impossible to know which high schools are 'the best' in the nation, "their letter read. in part. "Determining whether different schools do or don't offer a high quality of education requires a look at man different measures, including students' overall academic accomplishments and their subsequent performance in college. And taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities."
　　In the end, the superintendents agreed to provide the data we sought, which is, after all, public information. There is, in our view, no real dispute here, we are all seeking the same thing, which is schools that better serve our children and our nation by encouraging students to tackle tough subjects under the guidance of gifted teachers. And if we keep working toward that goal, someday, perhaps a list won't be necessary.

　　Answer Sheer 2  with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　In times of economic crisis. Americans turn to their families for support. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent. an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.
　　We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses, By 1932. when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929 But this doesn't mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone.
　　Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households, Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes.
　　After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities, A 1940 book. The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job "with tireless search for work."He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.
　　The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale(士气). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.
　　Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.
　　Today's economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably(无法弥补地)ruined. So it's only when the economy is healthy again that we'll begin to see just how many broken families have been created.

He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites."I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them," Schrage admits.

　　Because conflict and disagreements are part of all close relationships, couples need to learn strategies for managing conflict in a healthy and constructive way. Some couples just   67   and deny the presence of any conflict in a relationship.   68   ,denying the existence of conflict results in couples    69   to solve their problems at early    70   ,which can then lead to even greater problems later   71   .Not surprisingly, expressing anger and disagreement leads to lower marital (婚姻的)satisfaction at the beginning. However, this pattern of behavior   72   increases in marital satisfaction over time. Research suggests that working   73   conflicts is an important predictor of marital satisfaction.
　　So, what can you do to manage conflict in your own relationships? First, try to understand the other person's point of view   74   put yourself in his of her place. People who are   75    to what their partner thinks and feels   76   greater relationship satisfaction. For example, researchers found that among people in dating relationships    77   marriages, those who can adopt their partner's perspective show more positive   78   .more relationship-enhancing attributes and more constructive responses   79    conflict.
　　Second, because conflict and disagreements are an   80    part of close relationships. People need to be able to apologize to their partner for wrongdoing and    81    forgiveness from their parents for their own acts. Apologies minimize conflict, lead to forgiveness, and serve to restore relationship closeness. In line    82    this view, spouses who are more forgiving show higher mental   83    over time. Increasingly, apologizing can even have    84    health benefits. For example, when people reflect on hurtful   85    and grudges(怨恨)，they show negative physiological(生理的) effects, including   86    heart rate and blood pressure, compared to when they reflect on sympathetic perspective-taking and forgiving.

标准答案
On Excessive Packaging
Nowadays the phenomena of excessive packaging of goods are prevailing in our society: clothes swathed in tissue paper, placed in cardboard box and finally wrapped in well-designed plastic bags, imported bottles of grape wine packed in wooden boxes, fruits put in hand-woven baskets, to name but a few.
There are several causes of excessive packaging. The first reason is that a large number of companies believe that they can attract customers’ attention and stimulate their purchasing desire by over-packaging their goods, thus gaining more profits. On the other hand, quite a number of consumers mistakenly hold that the more delicate the package is, the better the quality will be, thus encouraging excessive packaging.
In my point of view, excessive packaging has disastrous consequences, including the loss of precious resources, excessive consumption of water and energy, and unnecessary extraction of scarce land for landfill.
To solve the problem, it’s necessary to take the following measures. First, laws and regulations must be made to restrict excessive packaging of companies. In addition, we need to raise consumer’s awareness that excessive packaging doesn’t equal to high quality and advocate packaging recycling.

The thefts are not the carefully planned burglaries that you see in movies. (45)Things get stolen when it is just easy to steal them because they are left lying around unwatched.
　　Do we really need more police?Hiring more campus police would cost money, possibly making our tuition go up again.(46) A better way to solve this problem might be for all of us to be more careful with our things.

　　Conversation 1

　　W：Good evening, and welcome to this week’s Business World, the program for and about business people. Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?

　　M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I’ll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn’t let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I’d love being my own boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want。

　　W: You mean you don’t keep regular hours?

　　M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business is slower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early。

　　W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?

　　M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It’s great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers。

　　W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business。

　　Question 19-22 are based on the conversation you have just heard。

　　20.What did Mr. Kayne do before he took over the bicycle shop?

　　21.Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?

　　22.What do we learn about the people working in the shop?

　　Conversation 2

　　W: Well, the main activities in the region were historically steel and paper processing, I think。

　　M: Yes, but I’m not quite sure about the status of those industries now. Could you tell us something about that?

　　W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant, but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for 44% of industrial activity. So it’s still very important. In fact, 80% of Spain’s machine tools are from the Basque Country. As for paper processing, there’s still a little. But it’s no longer what it once was in the region. So, is that clear?

　　M: Yes, thanks。

　　W: Now, to get back to what I was saying, there’s a lot of unemployment as well as geographical problems in the region。

　　M: Sorry, Victoria. What do you mean by geographical problems?

　　W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts. So there used to be transport problems, now though there are new train links and better roads, but it may be that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected, is that OK? Does that make sense? When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory, we’ll see this in more detail, so we’ll come back to this question, OK?

　　Passage 1

　　I first met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old, which is probably the only reason he’s one of my best friends. If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school we wouldn’t even have had the chance to get to know each other. Joe is a day student, but I am a boarding student. We haven’t been in same classes, sports or extra-curricular activities. Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house and we talk on the phone every night. This is not to say that we would not have been compatible if we had first met in our freshman year. Rather, we would not have been likely to spend enough time getting to know each other due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests. In fact, to be honest, I struggle even now to think of things we have in common. But maybe that’s what makes us enjoy each other’s company so much. When I look at my friendship with Joe, I wonder how many people I’ve known whom I never disliked, but simply didn’t take the time to get to know. Thanks to Joe, I have realized how little basis there is for the social divisions that exist in every community. Since this realization, I have begun to make an even more determined effort to find friends in unexpected people and places。

　　Q:

　　26: Why does the speaker say Joe Ganz became one of his best friends?

　　27: Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?

　　28: What has the speaker learned from his friendship with Joe?

　　Passage 2

　　It was a bad night for Lewis. His research in the neighboring town has taken longer than he expected. It was late and he was very tired when he drove home. He turned into his building’s parking lot, but all the spaces were full. He drove back out onto the street, looking for a parking space. The first block was full. The next block was almost empty. Lewis didn’t see a “no parking” sign, but he has expected that his parking were allowed there. Most the spaces would be filled. Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces. He was so glad to see them that he didn’t even think to read the sign by the entrance. He drove in, parked and hurried home to go to bed. The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car. It was gone. He ran home and telephoned the city police to say that his car had been stolen. It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened: his car had been on a private lot. It had been taken away by the police. Lewis had to take a taxi to visit the city garage far from the city center. He had to pay a fee of 40 dollars to get his car back. In addition, he got a parking ticket, his first one ever in Greenville。

　　Q:

　　29: Where did Lewis intend to park his car when he came back from work one night?

　　30: What did Lewis think had happened to his car the next morning?

　　31: Where did Lewis finally get his car back?

　　Passage 3

　　Well, to pick up where we left off last time, I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea. It was those things we all recognize when we see it, but we don’t really understand what it is. We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative, but we don’t know how they got that way. Is creativity a natural gift like good looks, or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge? Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully, we might get some insight into what it is and how it might work in our lives. The creative process has always been accepted as the source of all important work in the arts, but we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts. Every major scientific discovery began with someone imagining the world to look differently from the way others saw it. And this is what creativity is all about -- imagining the world in a new way. And despite what you may believe about the limits of your own creative imaginations, we all have the potential to imagine the world in an absolutely new way. In fact, you are born with it. It is your birth right as a human being. And what’s more, you use it every day, almost every moment of your life. Your creative imagination is what you use to make sense of your experiences. It’s your creative mind that gets meaning from chaos of experiences and brings order to your world。

　　32. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?

　　33. What is the widely accepted idea about the creative process?

　　34. What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?

　　35. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?

　　Students have been complaining more and more about stolen property. Radios, cell phones, bicycles, pocket calculators and books have all been reported stolen. Are there enough campus police to do the job? There are twenty officers in the campus security division. Their job is to handle crime, accidents, lost-and-found items and traffic problems on campus. More than half of their time is spent directing traffic and writing parking tickets.  Responding promptly to accidents and other emergencies is important, but it is their smallest job. Dealing with crime takes up the rest of their time. Very rarely do any violent crimes actually occur. In the last five years. There have been no murders, seven robberies and about 60 other violent attacks, most of these involving fights at parties. On the other hand, there have been hundreds of thefts and cases of deliberate damaging of public  property, which usually involves breaking windows or lights or writing on walls. The thefts are not the carefully planned burglaries that you see in movies. Things get stolen when it’s easy to steal them, because they are left lying around unwatched. Do we really need more police? Hiring more campus police will cost money, possibly making our tuition go up again. A better way to solve this problem might be for all of us to be more careful with our things。

　Part Ⅱ Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes)
　　Directions:  In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7 choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentence with the information given in the passage.
Why Integrity Matters
　　What Is Integrity?
　　The key to integrity is consistency- not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each and every day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and ethical (道德上的) standards even when making life's hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.
　　What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a lapse (缺失) of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus integrity must be one of our most important goals.
　　Risky Business 
　　We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision, making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.
　　Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn't know the rules a about plagiarism (剽窃) may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct, Ignorance is not a defense.
　　"But Everybody Does It"
　　Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts but manage to fool themselves about the risks they're taking by using excuses: "Everyone else does it." "I'm not hurting anyone", or "I really need this grade." Excuses can get very elaborate: "I know I'm look at another's exam, even though I'm supposed to keep my eyes on my own paper, but that's not cheating because I’m just checking my answers, not copying." We must be honest about our actions and avoid excuses, if we fool ourselves into believing we're not doing anything wrong, we can't see the real choice we're making - and that leads to bad decisions.
      To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over yore shoulder. If you'd rather hide your actions, that's an indication that you're taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.
  Evaluating Risks 
      To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immolate benefits and simply haven't considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious and may include a "O" on a test or assignment, an "F" in the class, suspension (暂令停学) or dismissal from school and a ruined reputation. In fact, when you break a role or law, you lose control over your life and give others the power to impose punishment that you have no control over. This is an extremely vulnerable (脆弱的) position. There may be some matters of life and death or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren't many things that fall in this category.
 Getting Away with it - Or Not 
     Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn't learn from the test, which deprives (剥夺) him her of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-respect and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty and afraid of getting caught. 
Worst of all, a cheater who doesn't get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems "easier." This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences.
  Cheating Hurts Other, Too 
     Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions "don't count" and don't really hurt anyone. But individual choices have an intense cumulative (累积的) effect. Cheating can spread like a disease. Recent statistics suggest 30％ or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others' grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating "poisons" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. ("If I don't cheat I can't compete with those who do") Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of goof teaching is seeing students learn. But a cheater says. "I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach, all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others." The end result is a destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the university and harm those who worked hard for their degree.
  Why Integrity Marten 
     If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others, if not, we couldn't put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist--the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.
In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.

PartⅣ Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)   (25 minutes)
　　
Section A 
　　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　
　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　With the world's population estimated to grow from six to nine billion by 2050, researchers. businesses and governments are already dealing with the impact this increase will have on everything from food and water to infrastructure (基础设施) and jobs. Underling all this 47 will be the demand for energy, which is expected to double over the next 40 years.
　　Finding the resources to meet this demand in a   48  . sustainable way is the cornerstone (基石) of our nation's energy security, and will be one of the major   49   of the 21st century. Alternative forms of energy- bio-fuels, wind and solar, to name a few are  50   being funded and developed, and will play a growing   51   in the world's energy supply. But experts say that even when   52  , alternative energy sources will likely meet only about 30% of the world's energy needs by 2050.
　　For example, even with  53   investments, such as the $93 million for wind energy development  54  in  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, important alternative energy sources such as wind and bio-fuels  55   only about 1% of the market today.
　　Energy and sustainability experts say the answer to our future energy needs will likely come from a lot of  56   both traditional and alternative.

　　Section  B 
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four chokes marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　
Passage One 
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.
　　Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity (阳刚), the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to conform to a stereotype. a US study says.
　　Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to conform to the "boy code" of hiding their emotions to be a "real man".
　　The findings of the study so against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.
　　Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being faded by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.
　　The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.
　　But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.
　　Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with "boy-focused" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given "hands-on" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. "Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine (女性的) and prefer the modem genre (类型) in which violence and sexism are major themes, "James wrote.
　　Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be "masterful and in charge" in relationships. "In mixed schools boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, " the study reported.

Passage Two 
　　Questions 62 to 66 are bated on the following passage.
　　It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off and we have no savings to save us. I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year - we just won't go.
　　Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday A YouGov poll of 2, 000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession - financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterized by intense verbal ( 言语上的) aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved and made men, more than women, extremely angry.
　　Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolizes, which may be different things to men and women. "People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for." he explains. "They'll say it's to save to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them." He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.
　　"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other know what's going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be more of a taboo (禁忌) about talking about money than about death.

Part III Listening Comprehension
2011年12月四级听力(听力原文)
Section A
11.W: This crazy bus schedule has got me completely confused. I can’t figure out when my bus to Cleveland leaves?
M: Why don’t you just go to the ticket window and ask?
Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?
12.W: I really enjoyed the TV special about drafts last night. Did you get home in time to see it?
W: Oh, yes, but I wish I could have stayed awake long enough to see the whole thing.
Q: What does the man mean?
13.W: Airport, please. I’m running a little late. So just take the fastest way even if it’s not the most direct.
M: Sure, but there is a lot of traffic everywhere today because of the football game.
Q: What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?
14.W: May I make a recommendation, sir? Our seafood with this special sauce is very good.
M: Thank you, but I don’t eat shellfish. I’m allergic to it.
Q: Where does this conversation most probably take place?
15. W: now one more question if you don’t mind, what position in the company appeals to you most?
M: Well, I’d like the position of sales manager if that position is still vacant.
Q: What do we learn about the man?
16. M: I don’t think I want to live in the dormitory next year. I need more privacy.
W: I know what you mean. But check out the cost if renting an apartment first. I won’t be surprised if you change your mind.
Q: What does the woman imply?
17. M: You’re on the right track. I just think you need to narrow the topic down.
W: Yeah, you’re right. I always start by choosing two boarder topics when I’m doing a research paper.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
18. W: This picnic should beat the last one we went to, doesn’t it?
M: Oh, yeah, we had to spend the whole time inside. Good thing, the weather was cooperative this time.
What do we learn about the speakers from the conversation?
Long Conversation
Conversation One
M: When I say I live in Sweden, people always want to know about the seasons.
W: The seasons?
M: Yeah, you know how cold it is in winter? What is it like when the days are so short?
W: So what is it like?
M: Well, it is cold ,very cold in winter. Sometimes it is cold as 26 degrees below centigrade. And of course when you go out, you’ll wrap up warm. But inside in the houses it’s always very warm, much warmer than at home. Swedish people always complain that when they visit England, the houses are cold even in the good winter.
W: And what about the darkness?
M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there’s only one hour of daylight, so you really looks forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing, from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It’s still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.
W: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun.
M: Yeah, that’s right, but it’s wonderful. You won’t stay up all night. And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. They’d like to work hard, but play hard, too. I think Londoners work longer hours, but I’m not sure this is a good thing.

Q19: What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
Q20: What do Swedish people complain about when they visit England in winter?
Q21: How does the man describe the short hour of daylight around Christmas in Sweden?
Q21: What does the man say about the Swedish people?
Conversation Two
W: What kind of training does one need to go into this type of job?
M: That’s a very good question. I don’t think there is any, specifically.
W: For example, in your case, what was your educational background?
M: Well, I did a degree in French at Nottingham. After that, I did careers work in secondary schools like the careers guidance people. Here is in the university. Then I went into local government because I found I was more interested in the administrative side. Then progressed on to universities. So there wasn’t any plan and there was no specific training. There are plenty of training courses in management techniques and committee work which you can attend now.
W: But in the first place, you did a French degree.
M: In my time, there wasn’t a degree you could do for administration. I think most of the administrators I’ve come across have degrees and all sorts of things.
W: Well, I know in my case, I did an English literature degree and I didn’t really expect to end up doing what I am doing now.
M: Quite.
W: But you are local to Nottingham, actually? Is there any reason why you went to Nottingham University?
M: No, no, I come from the north of England, from west Yorkshire. Nottingham was one of the universities I put on my list. And I like the look of it. The campus is just beautiful.
W: Yes, indeed. Let’s see. Were you from the industrial part of Yorkshire?
M: Yes, from the Woolen District.
Q23. What was the man’s major at university?
Q24: What was the man’s job in secondary schools?
Q25: What attracted the man to Nottingham University?
Section B
Passage One
While Gail Obcamp, an American artist was giving a speech on the art of Japanese brush painting to an audience that included visitors from Japan, she was confused to see that many of her Japanese listeners have their eyes closed. Were they tuned off because an American had the nerve to instruct Japanese in their own art form or they deliberately tried to signal their rejection of her? Obcamp later found out that her listeners were not being disrespectful. Japanese listeners sometimes closed their eyes to enhance concentration. Her listeners were showing their respect for her by chewing on her words. Some day you may be either a speaker or a listener in a situation involving people from other countries or members of minority group in North America. Learning how different cultures signal respect can help you avoid misunderstandings. Here are some examples. In the deaf culture of North America, many listeners show applause not by clapping their hands but by waving them in the air. In some cultures, both overseas and in some minority groups in North America, listeners are considered disrespectful if they look directly at the speaker. Respect is shown by looking in the general direction but avoiding direct eye contact. In some countries, whistling by listeners is a sign of approval while in other courtiers it is a form of insult.
Questions:
26, What did Obcamp’s speech focus on?
27, Why do Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes while listening to a speech?
28, What does the speaker try to explain?
Passage Two
Chris is in charge of purchasing and maintaining equipment in his Division at Taxlong Company. He is soon going to have an evaluation interview with his supervisor and the personnel director to discuss the work he has done in the past year. Salary, promotion and plans for the coming year will also be discussed at the meeting. Chris has made several changes for his Division in the past year. First, he bought new equipment for one of the departments. He has been particularly happy about the new equipment because many of the employees have told him how much it has helped them. Along with improving the equipment, Chris began a program to train employees to use equipment better and do simple maintenance themselves. The training saved time for the employees and money for the company. Unfortunately, one serious problem developed during the year. Two employees the Chris hired were stealing, and he had to fire them. Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing and maintenance manager for the whole company will be open in a few months, and he would like to be promoted to the job. Chris knows, however, that someone else wants that new job, too. Kim is in charge of purchasing and maintenance in another Division of the company. She has also made several changes over the year. Chris knows that his boss likes Kim’s work, and he expects that his work will be compared with hers.
Questions 29 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
29. What is Chris’s main responsibility at Taxlong Company?
30. What problem did Chris encounter in his Division?
31. What does Chris hope for in the near future?
32. What do we learn about Kim from the passage?
Passage Three
Proverbs, sometimes called sayings, are examples of folk wisdom. They are little lessons which older people of a culture pass down to the younger people to teach them about life. Many proverbs remind people of the values that are important in the culture. Values teach people how to act, what is right, and what is wrong. Because the values of each culture are different, understanding the values of another culture helps explain how people think and act. Understanding your own culture values is important too. If you can accept that people from other cultures act according to their values, not yours, getting along with them will be much easier. Many proverbs are very old. So some of the values they teach may not be as important in the culture as they once were. For example, Americans today do not pay much attention to the proverb “Haste makes waste”, because patience is not important to them. But if you know about past values, it helps you to understand the present and many of the older values are still strong today. Benjamin Franklin, a famous American diplomat, writer and scientist, died in 1790, but his proverb “Time is money” is taken more seriously by Americans of today than ever before. A?study?of proverbs from around the world shows that some values are shared by many cultures. In many cases though, the same idea is expressed differently.
Questions 33- 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. Why are proverbs so important?
34. According to the speaker what happens to some proverbs with the passage of time?
35 What do we learn from the?study?of proverbs from around the world?
Compound Dictation
Our lives are woven together. As much as I enjoy my own company, I no longer imagine I can get through a single day much less all my life completely on my own. Even if I am on vacation in the mountains, I am eating food someone else has grown, living in a house someone else has built, wearing clothes someone else has sewn from cloth woven by others, using electricity someone else is distributing to my house. Evidence of interdependence is everywhere; we are on this journey together.
As I was growing up, I remember being carefully taught that independence not interdependence was everything. “Make your own way”,” Stand on your own two feet” or my mother’s favorite remark when I was face-to-face with consequences of some action: Now that you’ve made your bed, lie on it.
Total independence is a dominant thing in our culture. I imagine that what my parents were trying to teach me was to take responsibilities for my actions and my choices. But the teaching was shaped by our cultural imagines. And instead, I grew up believing that I was supposed to be totally independent and consequently became very reluctant to ask for help. I would do almost anything not to be a burden, and not require any help from anybody.

2011年12月英语四级真题答案解析
Part I Writing
【标准版】Nothing Succeeds Without a Strong Will
　Nothing runs smoothly in our life. To achieve things successfully, a strong will is essential. Life is like a Marathon. Many people can’t get to the terminal. This is not because they are lack of vitality but because their will of success is not strong enough.
　To take quitting smoking as an example, some regard it as a piece of cake. They make up their minds to quit it in the morning, but in the evening they feel that the smell of cigarettes is tempting. Their throats are sore, their mouths are thirsty, and their hands are shaking. After the painful mental struggle, they tell themselves that “One cigarette is enough. Just take one, and the next day I will quit it.” By doing this, they surrender to their weak will. In the end, they have quitted smoking “a hundred times”, but in no time they succeed.
　Just like quitting smoking, nothing succeeds without a strong will. To be successful in one’s life, a strong will means that you know where you go and you will persist on the road you choose. Undoubtedly success belongs to those who overcome their weak will and who hang in there until the last minute.
　【文章点评】
本文属于话题类作文，只看题目 “Nothing Succeeds without a strong will”考生会觉得比较抽象，难以下手。细看题目说明中给出了提示，要求考生结合戒烟屡次不成功的幽默引语对该话题进行分析阐述。
　总体来说，这是一篇“中等偏上”的考生作文。本文先点题指出“坚强意志”的重要性；第二段从反面举例阐述——具体描写了意志不坚定者的心理活动，阐述为什么会戒烟失败；最后从戒烟延伸到生活中的其他事情，并复述坚强意志的内涵，点题收尾。
　总体上来看，文章思路清晰，采用了生动的比喻和形象的心理描写，语言流畅，用语地道。但一些重复表达（如第二段和第三段中的weak will）显得单调，可用shaky ones, weak-willed persons，the strong-willed等灵活表达。在备考中，多积累不同表达，相信会写出更生动的文章。
　在论述上，叙述略显罗嗦。第二段心理描写过多，虽然流畅生动，但却使这篇考场作文超过了规定字数，反而成为失分点，这一点要引以为戒。
　【高分版】Nothing Succeeds Without a Strong Will
　As we have read from above, quitting-smoking seems easy, but in reality it is rarely achieved. There is something provoking and interesting in this paradox, just because sword does not wear the stone as dripping water does.
　The ability to do something over and over again in a short time may imply its easiness, but in a long run, a lifetime maybe, things turn out to be quite the opposite. Also, as is often the case, one may have obtained all the tools and opportunities to achieve something, but in the end they still fail due to the will shortage.
　So how could we avoid the dilemma? Here is the prime condition of success: will and perseverance. Concentrate you energy, thought and mind exclusively on the business in which you are engaged, hang on in there and be patient, for, as Emerson put it, no one can cheat you out of your ultimate success but yourself.
【文章点评】
本次四级作文探讨的话题是成功与毅力之间的关系，话题不算新，一般考生对此都比较熟悉，所以对考生来说难度不大。写好这篇作文，需要抓住两点，一是紧跟题目要求，即对上述幽默性的话语做出评论，二是在评论的基础上要亮出自己的观点。
范文开头第一句即一针见血地对上述幽默性话语做出总结性概括，即戒烟看似简单实则很难，随后指出该话语本质上是一个悖论，并且以一个“水滴石穿”的俗语来指出困难所在，这句也是本文的一个亮点，体现作者在西方俗语方面丰富的知识储备。
第二段作者则进一步深入分析该话语，指出做某事在短期看来很容易，长期来看，恰恰相反，人们做事的结果也因此总是失败，原因则在最后一句点出：缺乏毅力。
第三段作者进一步给出了自己的观点，告诉大家如何避免陷入这种两难境地：首要条件即需要坚强的意志和长期的坚持。最后再以艾默生的一句名言 “没人能够骗你远离你最终的成功，除非你自己承认失败”来总结全文，切中主题，铿锵有力。
　　Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)
1.【答案】A) sticks to them in their daily life
【解析】第一题的答案就在全文第一句。关键词是not only…. But also…. ，关键句是The key to integrity is consistency--not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each day. 这里的live up to 和 选项里的 stick to 属于同义替换。
2.【答案】C) It is the basis of mutual trust
【解析】关键词是personal and professional，关键句是Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.
结合紧接着的问句，我们很容易锁定trust这个选项。
3.【答案】A. To ensure we make responsible choices.
【解析】关键词是identify the risks，关键句是Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. 所以答案很明显是A。
4.【答案】B. it is claimed to be unintentional.
【解析】关键词是misconduct，关键句是But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct. 和原文意义高度一致的，就是这个unintentional。因此答案是：B. it is claimed to be unintentional.
5. 【答案】A. Avoid making excuses.
【解析】关键词是fool oneself，关键句是To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test这里的watch out for 和 选项里的avoid属于同义替换。所以答案是A。
6.【答案】C. value immediate benefits most.
【解析】关键词是regret later，关键句是Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits ("what's in it for me")。很明显，选项 value immediate benefits most 是正确答案。这里的value 和 focus on 属于同义替换。
7.【答案】A) pay more dearly
【解析】关键词是get caught，关键句是Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. 这里的higher price 和选项里的more dearly 属于同义替换。所以答案是A。
8. 【答案】steal a grade
【解析】关键词：care about
关键句：I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others."
9.【答案】honesty and good faith
【解析】关键词是rely on，关键句是We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others every day.
10.【答案】the Watergate scandal
【解析】关键词是political and economic leaders，关键句是Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole.
PartⅣ Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)
Section A【解析】这是一篇讨论能源资源的说明文，话题是考生比较熟悉的能源问题，不断增长的人口与可再生资源的矛盾该如何解决。文中指出能源的一些可替代形式如生物能源、风能太阳能等可再生资源将在未来发挥越来越重要的作用。但是专家指出，即使这些资源储备量惊人，但是到2050年也只能满足世界30%的需求。文章最后两段探讨了各能源在市场上的需求，以及解决未来能源需求的其他方案。
总体来说，这篇文章理解难度不大，填空难度适中，所选词汇也都是四级考纲的词汇。选项较具有干扰项，多为c和s开头的单词，考生在考试时要特别注意。
Section B
Passage One【解析】这篇文章针对传统的男女生一起上学，一起接受教育提出了质疑。作者从文章一开头就表明了自己的看法：对于男生而言，单性教育，即男生们一起上学会对男生的身心发展更为有利。文中出现一个短语，received wisdom，即是“人们普遍的看法，公认的看法”。也是作者所批判的一种观点。传统观点认为，男生和女生混合教育会对男生发展更有利。
但是作者认为单性教育对男生有以下几个好处：可以让男生们更自由地表达自己的情感，可以学习自己感兴趣的艺术，舞蹈，音乐等学科。不用去遵守人们在传统印象中对男生的期盼。而且单性教育可以针对男生的身心发展特点而制定学习计划。
并且作者觉得，目前英国教育把女生当做关注重点，忽视了对男生的重视。
Passage Two【解析】这是一篇关于金钱对夫妻关系的影响的文章。文中第一段主要通过度假这件事来体现不同人对待金钱的不同态度。作者认为人只能活一次，如果不能去度假的话，那么工作再努力也没有意义。第二段主要谈到了大萧条时期，不太良好的经济状况常常会影响夫妻关系，可能会导致争吵，甚至会导致离婚或者分居的成本增加，对夫妻感情造成伤害。第三段讲了Kim Stephenson，一个心理学家的观点，即男人和女人对待金钱的态度是不一样的，男人把金钱看作是得到社会地位的途径，看作向父母展现自己成功的一种方式。第四段，作者建议夫妻可以对金钱持有不同的观点，但是不可以对它采取回避的态度，避而不谈。
相对来说，这篇文章的难度比较大。文章看懂并不难，但是题目中，推理题和大意题比较多，需要在充分理解作者意图，了解文章主旨的基础上，才能选出正确答案。
Part V Cloze
67.【答案】reveals
【解析】第一段提出话题，“据一项最新调查显示，现在的雇主们害怕他们雇不到符合要求的毕业生”，launch意思为“发起一场运动”，submit意为“提交，服从”，generate生成，reveal透露，揭露，显示。这里根据段意，reveal最合适。
68.【答案】staff
【解析】根据句意，基本有一半的组织机构告诉调查者他们在努力寻找具有四个方面（科学、技术、工程和数学）才能的职员。这里partners，audience, officials显然不符合题意。
69.【答案】while
【解析】这里和前面已经叙述的事实构成并列，“同时，更多公司预测，接下来的三年他们都将会遭遇雇员四缺现象（科学、技术、工程和数学知识技能欠缺）”，因此排除其他三项。选while。
70.【答案】shortages
【解析】由第二段句首struggling可判断，机构组织寻找这些人才非常不易，那么这种人才显然是不够的，短缺的。absence是表示“缺席，不在”，不能描述短缺，因此排除。此题的另一个关键是确定experience的词性，动词。
71.【答案】surveyed
【解析】第三段用一句话简介经过工业联盟调查了69个行业和组织，首先排除D和C，search是指搜查；细查某处以搜寻某人或某物，搜索；而survey是指调查某部分人的行为、意见等（通常以询问方式进行），符合题意。
72.【答案】private
【解析】根据上一题的意思，调查在公共和私人部门中展开，后面一句的together暗示and后面的这个空是和“公共的”对立的，因此填private。
73.【答案】concerned
【解析】第四段描写了这个调查的具体情况。有一半人…，这里缺少动词，confront一般和with连用，conform 符合，遵照，confuse 使混乱，使困惑，这里根据上下文的意思，雇主们都担心这种现象的发生，因此选concerned, be concerned 担心的，烦恼的，忧虑的。
74.【答案】recruit
【解析】本题考查词义辨析，三分之一的被调查者坦言他们可能顾不到符合相应资质的雇员，只有recruit符合题意。
75.【答案】As

British Cuisine: the Best of Old and New
   British cuisine (烹饪) has come of age in recent years as chefs (厨师) combine the best of old and new.
   Why does British food have a reputation for being so bad? Because it is bad! Those are not the most encouraging words to hear just before eating lunch at one of Hong Kong's smartest British restaurants, Alfie's by KEE, but head chef Neil Tomes has more to say.
   "The past 15 years or so have been a noticeable period of improvement for food in England," the English chef says, citing the trend in British cuisine for better ingredients, preparation and cooking methods, and more appealing presentation. Chefs such as Delia Smith, Nigel Slater, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay made the public realise that cooking - and eating - didn't have to be a boring thing. And now, most of the British public is familiar even with the extremes of Heston BlumenthaPs molecular gastronomy, a form of cooking that employs scientific methods to create the perfect dish.
   "It's no longer the case that the common man in England is embarrassed to show he knows about food," Tomes says.
   There was plenty of room for improvement. The problems with the nation's cuisine can be traced back to the Second World War. Before the War, much of Britain's food was imported and when German U-boats began attacking ships bringing food to the country, Britain went on rations (配给).
   "As rationing came to an end in the 1950s, technology picked up and was used to mass-produce food," Tomes says. "And by then people were just happy to have a decent quantity of food in their kitchens."
   They weren't looking for cured meats, organic produce or beautiful presentation; they were looking for whatever they could get their hands on, and this prioritisation of quantity over quality prevailed for decades, meaning a generation was brought up with food that couldn't compete with neighbouring France, Italy, Belgium or Spain.
   Before star chefs such as Oliver began making cooking fashionable, it was hard to find a restaurant in London that was open after 9pm. But in recent years the capital's culinary (烹饪的) scene has developed to the point that it is now confident of its ability to please the tastes of any international visitor.
   With the opening of Alfie's in April, and others such as The Pawn, two years ago, modern British food has made its way to Hong Kong. "With British food, I think that Hong Kong restaurants are keeping up," says David Tamlyn, the Welsh executive chef at The Pawn in Wan Chai. "Hong Kong diners are extremely responsive to new ideas or presentations, which is good news for new dishes."
   Chefs agree that diners in Hong Kong are embracing the modern British trend. Some restaurants are modifying the recipes (菜谱) of British dishes to breathe new life into the classics, while others are using better quality ingredients but remaining true to British traditions and tastes.
   Tamlyn is in the second camp. "We select our food very particularly. We use US beef, New Zealand lamb and for our custards (牛奶蛋糊) we use Bird's Custard Powder," Tamlyn says. "Some restaurants go for custard made fresh with eggs, sugar and cream, but British custard is different, and we stay true to that."
   Matthew Hill, senior manager at the two-year-old SoHo restaurant Yorkshire Pudding, also uses better ingredients as a means of improving dishes. "There are a lot of existing perceptions about British food and so we can't alter these too much. We're a traditional British restaurant so there are some staples (主菜) that will remain essentially unchanged."
   These traditional dishes include fish and chips, steak and kidney pie and large pieces of roasted meats. At Alfie's, the newest of the British restaurants in town and perhaps the most gentlemen's club-like in design, Neil Tomes explains his passion for provenance (原产地). "Britain has started to become really proud of the food it's producing. It has excellent organic farms, beautifully crafted cheeses, high-quality meats."
   However, the British don't have a history of exporting their foodstuffs, which makes it difficult for restaurants in Hong Kong to source authentic ingredients.
   "We can get a lot of our ingredients once a week from the UK," Tamlyn explains. "But there is also pressure to buy local and save on food miles, which means we take our vegetables from the local markets, and there are a lot that work well with British staples."
   The Phoenix, in Mid-Levels, offers the widest interpretation of "British cuisine", while still trying to maintain its soul. The gastro-pub has existed in various locations in Hong Kong since 2002. Singaporean head chef Tommy Teh Kum Chai offers daily specials on a blackboard, rather than sticking to a menu. This enables him to reinterpret British cuisine depending on what is available in the local markets.
   "We use a lot of ingredients that people wouldn't perhaps associate as British, but are presented in a British way. Bell peppers stuffed with couscous, alongside ratatouille, is a very popular dish."
   Although the ingredients may not strike diners as being traditional, they can be found in dishes across Britain.
   Even the traditional chefs are aware of the need to adapt to local tastes and customs, while maintaining the Britishness of their cuisine.
   At Yorkshire Pudding, Hill says that his staff asks diners whether they would like to share their meals. Small dishes, shared meals and "mixing it up" is not something commonly done in Britain, but Yorkshire Pudding will bring full dishes to the table and offer individual plates for each diner. "That way, people still get the presentation of the dishes as they were designed, but can carve them up however they like," Hill says.
   This practice is also popular at The Pawn, although largely for rotisseries (烤肉馆), Tamlyn says. "Some tables will arrive on a Sunday, order a whole chicken and a shoulder of lamb or a baby pig, and just stay for hours enjoying everything we bring out for them."
   Some British traditions are too sacred (神圣的) to mess with, however, Tomes says. "I'd never change a full English breakfast."

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
   Several recent studies have found that being randomly (随机地) assigned to a roommate of another race can lead to increased tolerance but also to a greater likelihood (可能性) of conflict.
   Recent reports found that lodging with a student of a different race may decrease prejudice and compel students to engage in more ethnically diverse friendships.
   An Ohio State University study also found that black students living with a white roommate saw higher academic success throughout their college careers. Researchers believe this may be caused by social pressure.
   In a New York Times article, Sam Boakye – the only black student on his freshman year floor -said that "if you're surrounded by whites, you have something to prove."
Researchers also observed problems resulting from pairing interracial students in residences.
   According to two recent studies, randomly assigned roommates of different races are more likely to experience conflicts so strained that one roommate will move out.
   An Indiana University study found that interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester.
   Grace Kao, a professor at Penn said she was not surprised by the findings. "This may be the first time that some of these students have interacted, and lived, with someone of a different race," she said.
At Penn, students are not asked to indicate race when applying for housing.
   "One of the great things about freshman housing is that, with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly," said Undergraduate Assembly chairman Alec Webley. "This is the definition of integration."
   "I've experienced roommate conflicts between interracial students that have both broken down stereotypes and reinforced stereotypes," said one Penn resident advisor (RA). The RA of two years added that while some conflicts "provided more multicultural acceptance and melding (融合)," there were also "jarring cultural confrontations."
   The RA said that these conflicts have also occurred among roommates of the same race.
   Kao said she cautions against forming any generalizations based on any one of the studies, noting that more background characteristics of the students need to be studied and explained.

Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.
　　The report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition (营养不良) and heat-related health problems.
　　But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.
　　Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.
　　Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was "a methodological embarrassment" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable (易受伤害的) regions. Dr. Pielke said that “climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.” But the report, he said, "will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed (有瑕疵的)."
   However, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.
   In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.
62.	What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?
A) Global temperatures affect the rate of economic development.
B) Rates of death from illnesses have risen due to global warming.
C) Malnutrition has caused serious health problems in poor countries.
D) Economic trends have to do with population and natural disasters.
63.	What do we learn about the Forum's report from the passage?
A) It was challenged by some climate and risk experts.
B) It aroused a lot of interest in the scientific circles.
C) It was warmly received by environmentalists.
D) It caused a big stir in developing countries.
64.	What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum's report?
A) Its statistics look embarrassing.		C) It deserves our closest attention.
B) It is invalid in terms of methodology. 	D) Its conclusion is purposely exaggerated.
65.	What is Soren Andreasen's view of the report?
A) Its conclusions are based on carefully collected data.
B) It is vulnerable to criticism if the statistics are closely examined.
C) It will give rise to heated discussions at the Copenhagen conference.
D) Its rough estimates are meant to draw the attention of world leaders.
66.	What does Kofi Annan say should be the focus of the Copenhagen conference?
A) How rich and poor regions can share responsibility in curbing global warming.
B) How human and economic losses from climate change can be reduced.
C) How emissions of heat-trapping gases can be reduced on a global scale.
D) How rich countries can better help poor regions reduce climate hazards.

　　标准版
　　Doing Shopping Online
　　With the development of the Internet, shopping is no longer a tiring thing. Just click your mouse to choose the articles you like, and the purchase is done. You don't even have to step out of the room. It seems all easy and quick.
　　However, people's opinions vary on this trend. Some believe that on line shopping is time and money saving. With plentiful selection options, they can buy whatever they like at any time convenient. Still others insist that mis-purchasing alone is annoying enough, not to mention the credibility of the sellers and the safety of their accounts.
　　In my opinion, the convenience and excitement of on line shopping is beyond all doubts. In the meantime, we must always bear in mind that certain traps do exist, so we'd better make sure the sellers are trustworthy before buying. In addition, we should also guard ourselves from the potential hackers who might steal our account information.
　　文章点评：
　　这是一篇“中等偏上”的学生作文。 本文先对网购热潮进行简介，引出全篇；接着对网络购物的正反两方面进行对比；最后提出自己的看法结束全篇。整体看思路清晰，逻辑严密，行文流畅，用语较为地道。
　　下面说一下这篇文章的有待提高之处：
　　1. 文章结构上，能看得出该同学试图采用议论文的“三段式”（提出问题、分析问题、解决问题）。 但是，以“With the development of the Internet”为开首语，有些落入俗套，有硬套模板的嫌疑。稍加注意，应该能写出更好的句子。
　　2. 微观语言点方面，有些语句稍显啰嗦，比如With plentiful selection options… 简化成With plentiful selections… 更好，意思没有丝毫减损，表达力反而增强许多。
　　高分版
　　With the help of the ever rapid development of internet technology, online shopping is coming into fashion in most of cities.
　　Online shopping is welcomed by most people due to various reasons. From the perspective of consumer, it can save some time for people who don't have much spare time. Just click the mouse, they can get whatever they want while staying at home. For the retailers, it can cut some costs for those who don't have much circulating funds. They don't have to rent a house and spend money on employees compared with the traditional trade mode. However, there are still some defects in online shopping. First, lace of face to face deal makes online shopping less reliable and trustworthy. Second, people will lose the fun of bargain.
　　It is undeniable that shopping on the internet has become an irresistible trend in modern society. It's of great urgency that we need to regulate the relative laws accordance with the rapid growth of online shopping. Only in this way can we enjoy the pleasure and convenience of online shopping without the concern of being treated.
　　点评：
　　本次四级作文探讨的是最近的热点话题之一——互联网网购。目前网购的风靡程度是众所周知，因此，考生对于该话题还是比较熟悉的。但是，比较特殊的是，题干所列出的要求的是考生从一个客观的角度来阐述该话题，而不是简单陈述自己的意见。所以，考生应当审清楚题，在写作时不仅仅要列出网购的优点，还必须给出相应的缺点。
　　按照四级作文的要求，考生在第一段时应该总述现象并引出话题；
　　第二段考生应当从正反两方面来论述网购，分别铺陈其优缺点；关于优点，网购的优点很多，考生可择其最突出显著的方面来阐述，比如说网购可以节省很多时间；网购可以节省很多成本开支等；其次，缺点方面考生可以把重心放在诚信方面；为了不至于跟优点相比，缺点方面太轻，考生可以考虑稍微提一下其他缺点，比如说与传统购物相比，网购少去了很多砍价的乐趣；
　　第三点要求考生对于第二段列出的缺点给出自己的建议。此处我们可以根据第二段列出的缺点方面给出相应的防范应对措施。
　　整篇作文话题比较好展开，难度不大，只要考生审好题，列出相应点，相信作文不会他是难题。
　　外教版
　　Online shopping has been a boon to many industries and companies looking to expand their markets. Also, it's convenient for shoppers who are too busy to leave the house. However, in some cases nothing can replace a true face to face shopping experience.
　　Internet shopping is convenient for the mothers who spend all day doing house chores and for the fathers who work a full-time job. On the other hand, there are limits to shopping online, for example: guessing the correct size of clothing on a computer screen can be very frustrating.
　　For the busy mother and father, online shopping is a very useful and convenient tool. But, there are instances, like clothes shopping, where nothing beats the real thing.
　　点评：

　　作者在第一段描述了网购作为一种时尚给大家的生活带来了便利，然后话锋一转，说网购仍然取代不了面对面的购物交流。
　　第二段主要还是从正反两方面分析了网购的优势和不足，以此描述大家对网购的不同反应。
　　第三段作者表明了自己的观点，对网购的便利和不足之处都做了描述。
　　综合来讲，本篇文章观点明确，结构清晰，语言表达地道，有不少闪光词汇，但是，内容深度上来讲还有些欠缺，另外，最后一部分表达个人观点，和第二段稍有重复。考生需要注意观点的清晰，不宜模棱两可。


　　Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)
　　1. B. Its bad taste
　　解析：题干中generally known for 对应原文a reputation for，根据原文第一句Why does British food have a reputation for being so bad? Because it is bad! 可知关键词为bad，故选B。
　　2. A. an inadequate supply of production

　　Part III Listening Comprehension
　　Section A
　　11.
　　M: Shawn's been trying for months to find a job. But I wonder how he could get a job when he looks like that.
　　W: Oh, that poor guy! He really should shave himself every other day at least and put on something clean.
　　Q: What do we learn about Shawn?
　　答案：A. He is careless about his appearance.
　　解析： 男生 首先对肖恩能否找到工作表示怀疑，因为他邋遢。 女生 接着提到肖恩不修边幅，又说他应该每隔一天刮一次胡子，把自己弄得整洁干净一点。由此可知，肖恩是一个对仪容仪表不太注重，比较粗线条的人shave，刮胡子；be careless about不在乎，不介意；
　　12.
　　W: I wish Jane would call when she know she'll be late. This is not the first time we've had to wait for her.
　　M: I agree. But she does have to drive through very heavy traffic to get here.
　　Q: What does the man imply?
　　答案：A. Jane maybe caught in a traffic jam.
　　解析：本题是推理题，在做题时要注意仔细推敲。女生说：“Jane已经不是第一次迟到让我们等了，我希望她能事先打电话告诉我们一下”，可见女生对Jane迟到的作法是不满的。
　　男生又说：“I agree. But she does have to drive through very heavy traffic to get here.”（我同意。但是她到这里的确要遭受很拥堵的交通。）由此得出，男生对此事的态度是理解或宽容的。Jane可能被堵在半路了。
　　13.
　　M: Congratulations! I heard your baseball team is going to the Middle Atlantic Championship.
　　W: Yeah, we're all working real hard right now!
　　Q: What is the woman's team doing?
　　答案：A. Training for the Mid-Atlantic Championship.
　　解析：对话开头男生提到女生所在的棒球队要参加Mid-Atlantic Championship.女生说：“we're all working real hard right now!”（我们现在正紧锣密鼓地练习呢！）由此可知，女生所在的棒球队正在进行赛前训练。
　　此题还有一个迷惑选项B, Making preparations for a trans-Atlantic trip,必须注意的是：这里并不是准备旅行，而是准备参赛。
　　14.
　　W: John's been looking after his mother in the hospital. She was injured in a car accident two weeks ago and still in critical condition.
　　M: Oh, that's terrible. And you know his father passed away last year.
　　Q: What do we learn about John?
　　答案：D. He has been having a hard time.
　　解析：根据听力原文可知，“John's mother is in the hospital and his father died last year.”（约翰的母亲出车祸住院了，父亲两年前也过世了）由此可见，John的近况还是蛮悲惨的；答案也就显而易见了。
　　15.
　　M: What a boring speaker! I can hardly stay awake.
　　W: Well, I don't know. In fact, I think it's been a long time since I've heard anyone is good.
　　Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
　　答案：D The woman thinks highly of the speaker
　　解析：根据听力原文可知，男生觉得演讲无趣，女生却很淡定地说：“其实我已经很久没有听到那么好的发言了”。由此可见，女生对发言还是很肯定的。选项D中“thinks highly of”即“对…评价高”，故D是正确答案。
　　16.
　　W: I'm having a lot of trouble with logic and it seems my professor can't explain it in a way that makes sense to me.
　　M: You know, there is a tutoring service on campus. I was about to drop statistics before they helped me out.
　　Q: What does the man mean?
　　答案：C. The woman should seek help from tutoring services.
　　解析：首先女生说她逻辑学得很辛苦，接受不了老师的讲课方式也理解不了课程内容。
　　而后男生说学校有辅导班，他在参加之前几乎要挂科了，辅导班帮了他大忙。言下之意是推荐女生也去上辅导班。
　　17.
　　M: This is a stylish overcoat. I saw you wearing it last week, did't I?
　　W: Oh, that wasn't me. That was my sister Jill. She's in your class.
　　Q: What does the woman mean?
　　答案：C. Jill wore the overcoat last week.
　　解析：首先男生问女生上周是否穿过拉风外套，然后女生说：“ That was my sister Jill. She's in your class.”（那是我姐姐Jill，她和你同班）也就是说男生很有可能看到的那个穿着拉风外套的人是女生的姐姐Jill。
　　18.
　　M: Jane, suppose you lost all your money while taking a vacation overseas, what would you do?
　　W: Well, I guess I'd sell my watch or computer or do some odd jobs till I could afford a return plane ticket.
　　Q: What are the speakers talking about?
　　答案：B. An imaginary situation.
　　解析：根据原文录音可知，对话开头男生讲到：“Jane, suppose you lost all your money while taking a vacation overseas, what would you do? ”这里的"suppose"表明“假定、料想”由此可见，两人谈论的是一个虚拟场景。
　　Conversation One
　　听力原文
　　M: Hello, professor Johnson.
　　W: Hello, Tony. So what shall we work on today?
　　M: Well, the problem is that this writing assignment isn't coming out right. What I thought I was writing on was to talk about what particular sport means to me when I participate in,
　　W: What sport did you choose?
　　M: I decided to write about cross-country skiing.
　　W: What are you going to say about skiing?
　　M: That's the problem. I thought I would write about how peaceful it is to be out in the country.
　　W: So why is that a problem?
　　M: As I start describing how quiet it is to be out in the woods. I keep mentioning how much effort it takes to keep going. Cross-country skiing isn't as easy as some people think. It takes a lot of energy, but that's not part of my paper. So I guess I should leave it out. But now I don't know how to explain that feeling of peacefulness without explaining how hard you have to work for it. It all fits together. It's not like just sitting down somewhere and watching the clouds roll by. That's different.
　　W: Then you'll have to include that in your point. The peacefulness of cross-country skiing is the kind you earn by effort. Why leave that out? Part of your point you knew before hand but part you discovered as you wrote. That's common, right?
　　M: Yeah, I guess so.
　　Q19: What is the topic of the man's writing assignment?
　　C) Pain and pleasure in sports
　　Q20: What problem does the man have while working on his paper?
　　D) He can't decide whether to include the effort part of skiing.
　　Q21: What does the woman say is common in writing papers?
　　A) New ideas come up as you write.
　　19. D) A sport he participates in
　　解析：题目问的是，男生论文的主题是什么，从talk about what particular sport means to me when I participate in一句中，可得对应选项D。C选项是一个干扰项，pain and pleasure in sports, 意为运动中的痛苦与快乐，其中sports一词范围太大，对话中只谈到了cross-country skiing, 因此，C选项错。
　　20. D) He can't decide whether to include the effort part of skiing.
　　解析：当男生打算将越野滑雪的艰辛剔除出论文时，教授说了一句“Then you'll have to include that in your point.”对应选项D
　　21. A) New ideas come up as you write.
　　解析：在对话的最后，教授提到“Part of your point you knew before hand but part you discovered as you wrote. That's common, right?”这句话意思是说，在写论文之前，论点的一部分我们已经有了，但另一部分在写的过程中才会发现，因此，对应选项A。A选项与D选项较易混淆，但从教授的话中，我们可以看出，不是论点发生变化，而是在写作过程中，会有新的想法产生。
　　这篇长对话因为是围绕论文写作展开，而且涉及了一项我们中国人并不熟悉的运动，越野滑雪，因此，乍听之下，有些小抽象，小陌生。但细听之后，我们会发现，文中有一大段都提到了男生在写作中遇到的纠结处，那就是越野滑雪的畅快和由此所付出的艰辛，文章的主旨自然呼之欲出了。
　　这篇对话主要考察对文章大意的理解，而不是纠结于一词一句的得失，因此，大家在做题时，也要注意把握主干，不要因为听到了一个自己不太熟悉的运动就舍本逐末。
　　Conversation Two
　　W: Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World.
　　It program for and about business people. Tonight we have Mr. Angeleno who came to the US six years ago, and is now an established businessman with three restaurants in town.Tell us Mr. Angeleno, how did you get started?
　　M: Well I started off with a small diner. I did all the cooking myself and my wife waited on tables. It was really too much work for two people. My cooking is great. And word got around town about the food. Within a year, I had to hire another cook and four waitresses. When that restaurant became very busy, I decided to expand my business. Now with three places my main concern is keeping the business successful and running smoothly.
　　W: Do you advertise?
　　M: Oh yes. I don't have any TV commercials, because they are too expensive. But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers. My children used to distribute ads. in nearby shopping centres, but we don't need to do that anymore.
　　W: Why do you believe you've been so successful?
　　M: Em, I always serve the freshest possible food and I make the atmosphere as comfortable and as pleasant as I can, so that my customers will want to come back.
　　W: So you always aim to please the customers?
　　M: Absolutely!Without them I would have no business at all.
　　W: Thank you Mr.Angeleno.I think your advice will be helpfull to those just staring out in business.
　　Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
　　22 What is the woman's occupation
　　D) Hostess of the weekly “Business World”
　　23 what do we learn about Mr.Angeleno's business at its beginning
　　B) He and his wife did everything by themselves.
　　24 what does Mr. Angeleno say about advertising his business.
　　B) He advertises a lot on radio and in newspapers.
　　25 What does the man say contribute to his success?
　　B) The restaurant atmosphere
　　22. D) Hostess of the weekly “Business World”
　　解析：从对话中可以听出，这是一个访谈节目，因此这个女性是节目主持人。
　　23. B) He and his wife did everything by themselves.
　　解析：题目问的是，刚开始的时候，Angeleno的生意怎么样？对话中提到，I did all the cooking myself and my wife waited on tables. Angeleno负责做菜，他妻子负责接待，对应选项B。
　　24. B) He advertises a lot on radio and in newspapers.
　　解析：从But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers. 一句中，可以得到对应选项。
　　25. B) The restaurant atomsphere
　　解析：题目问的是，什么有助于餐厅的成功？对话中提到，I always serve the freshest possible food and I make the atmosphere as comfortable and as pleasant as I can, so that my customers will want to come back. 可见，Angeleno会提供尽可能新鲜的食物和舒适的用餐环境以吸引顾客，因此，对应选项B，也许，有童鞋会问，为什么不选C？注意，C选项是指各种各样的食物，与文意中“新鲜的食物”不符，是错误选项。
　　这篇对话是一篇较为简单的访谈节目，主要涉及一些细节问题，其中，关键细节包括餐馆经营情况，广告宣传情况等，也是考点所在。童鞋们在听时，可以相应地做些简单的笔记，从而准确地选出选项。
　　Section B
　　Passage One
　　There are many commonly held beliefs about eye glasses and eyesight that are not proven facts. For instance, some people believe that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at a young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of vision if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes.
　　We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not permanently damage eyesight.
　　Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transferred from one person to another. There are close to one million nerve fibres that connect the eyeball to the brain, as of yet it is impossible to attach them all in a new person. Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if we keep clearing up the myths and learning more about the eyes, some day a full transplant may be possible.
　　篇章类型及提要：论证文
　　听力点睛：
　　本文主要介绍关于纠正一些对眼镜及视力的常识的错误认识。注意文章首句"There are many commonly held beliefs about eye glasses and eyesight that are not proven facts." 通常这种文章首句就是主旨句。这是做听力短文题必须要高度关注的。接下去可以推测下面内容必然围绕主题句展开，通过举例等来论证作者要表明的观点。所以听的时候也要高度专注那些关键词句，如for instance, however, but, evidence, although, Studies show that...这些关键词句后面的内容是听力常考的地方。最后文章给出一个总结句呼吁人们破除固有的一些认识，去更多了解我们的眼睛，头尾呼应。
　　Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.
　　26. What does the speaker want to tell us about eyesight?
　　答案：C）There are many false notions about it.
　　解析：从"eyesight" 可以把答案定位于第一段，关键词有"weakens the eyes" "loss of vision". 注意题目中是问speaker要告诉我们的，所以不要被some people believe...误导，看清题目要问什么很重要。容易混淆的是A选项，文中提到如果孩子戴不合适的眼镜会使孩子的视力减弱，但并没有提到孩子经常忽视保护视力。B、D选项文中没有提及，可以排除。
　　27. What do studies about wearing the wrong glasses show?
　　答案：C）It can lead to the loss of vision in children.
　　解析：本题关键词是"studies" "wearing the wrong glasses". 文章中作者很明显地给出了"Studies show that for adults..." 因此了解这个后面的内容，做出本题难度不大。文中说到 "for adults there is no danger" ，因此排除B选项。"there is no evidence... the structure of eyes is changed" "it does not permanently damage eyesight"可以排除D选项，注意如果漏听了no，很可能就会选错。A选项前文没有提及，可以排除。
　　28.What do we learn about eye transplanting from the talk?
　　答案：D）It can only be partly accomplished now.
　　解析：本题关键词"eye transplanting"，迅速定位于听力后面部分。A、B、C选项文中没有提及，排除。文章最后部分"Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced" "Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced"可以推断出答案是D选项。
　　Passage Two
　　When people care for an elderly relative, they often do not use available community services such as adult daycare centers. If the caregivers are adult children, they are more likely to use such services, especially because they often have jobs and other responsibilities. In contrast, a spouse usually the wife, is much less likely to use support services or to put the dependent person in a nursing home. Social workers discover that the wife normally tries to take care of her husband herself for as long as she can in order not to use up their life savings. Researchers have found that caring for the elderly can be a very positive experience. The elderly appreciated the care and attention they received. They were affectionate and cooperative. However, even when caregiving is satisfying, it is hard work. Social workers and experts on aging offer caregivers and potential caregivers help when arranging for the care of an elderly relative. One consideration is to ask parents what they want before they become sick or dependent. Perhaps they prefer going into a nursing home and can select one in advance. On the other hand, they may want to live with their adult children. Caregivers must also learn to state their needs and opinions clearly and ask for help from others especially brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters are often willing to help, but they may not know what to do
　　Questions 29 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
　　29. Why are adult children more likely to use community services to help care for elderly parents?
　　答案：D）They have jobs and other commitments.
　　解析：细节题。本题询问原因，文章开头很快就给出了本题答案"because they often have jobs and other responsibilities." 注意D选项中的commitments的意思是 “承诺，保证；承担义务”和responsibilities意思相近。这也是四级考试中常见的选项设置，用同义词或近义词替换掉文中的词汇。这要求考试在备考时，重点词汇及其同义词反义词都要有所了解。其他选项文中没有提及，可排除。
　　30. Why are most wives unwilling to put their dependent husbands into nursing homes?
　　答案：A) They don't want to use up all their life savings.
　　解析：细节题。关键词"wives"" husbands"。本题不难，文章中已经直接给出答案" in order not to use up their life savings"。
　　31. According to the passage, what must caregivers learn to do?
　　31. According to the passage, what must caregivers learn to do?
　　答案：C）Be frank and seek help from others.
　　解析：关键词"caregivers""learn to do"，问看护人应该要学会做的事情，然后迅速定位于最后部分，"One consideration is to ask..."，"Caregivers must also learn to state..." 主要有两件事情，C选项是其中一个，另外一个选项中没有，排除A、B和D选项。
　　Passage Three
　　Since a union representative visited our company to inform us about our rights and protections. My coworkers have been worrying about health conditions and complaining about safety hazards in the workplace. Several of the employees in the computer department, for example, claim to be developing vision problems from having to stare at a video display terminal for about 7 hours a day. The supervisor of the laboratory is beginning to get headaches and dizzy spells because she says it's dangerous to breathe some of the chemical smoke there. An X-rays technician is refusing to do her job until the firm agrees to replace its out-dated equipment. She insists that it's exposing workers to unnecessarily high doses of radiation. She thinks that she may have to contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and asked that government agency to inspect the department. I've heard that at a factory in the area two pregnant women who were working with paint requested a transfer to a safer department, because they wanted to prevent damage to their unborn babies. The supervisor of personnel refused the request. In another firm the workers were constantly complaining about the malfunctioning heating system, but the owners was too busy or too mean to do anything about it. Finally, they all met an agree to wear ski-clothing to work the next day. The owner was too embarrassed to talk to his employees. But he had the heating system replaced right away.
　　Questions 32- 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
　　32 What does the talk focus on?
　　A) Health and safety conditions in workplace.
　　解析：主旨题。本题简单，了解了文章主要内容后，就可以直接选出答案。注意不要被文章中员工们得对工作环境的complaints影响而混淆了。
　　33 What did the X-ray technician ask her company to do?
　　Replace its out-dated equipments.
　　答案：A）Replace its out-dated equipments.
　　解析：细节题。作者有直接读出答案，比较简单。
　　34 What does the speaker say about the two pregnant women working with paint?
　　A) They requested to transfer to a safer department.
　　答案：A) They requested to transfer to a safer department.
　　解析：细节题。作者有直接读出答案，比较简单。注意选B选项的同学可能犯了想当然的错误。做题还是要按照文章的事实根据来。
　　35 Why did the workers in the firm wear ski-clothing to work?
　　C) To protest against the poor working conditions.
　　答案：C）To protest against the poor working conditions.
　　解析：推理题。本题容易误选D选项。因为是heating system出了故障。但通过下文"too embarrassed""had the heating system replaced right away" 从老板的反应及采取的措施可以推断出，员工们穿滑雪服地原因其实为对差的工作环境向老板提出抗议。
　　Section C Compound Dictation
　　Contrary to the old warning that time waits for no one, time slows down when you are on the move. It also slows down more as you move faster, which means astronauts（宇航员） some day may survive so long in space that they would return to an earth of the distant future. If you could move at the speed of light, your time would stand still, if you could move faster than light, your time would move backward.
　　Although no form of matter yet discovered, moves as fast as or faster than light, scientific experiments has already confirmed that accelerated motion causes a traveler's time to be stretched. Albert Einstein predicted this in 1905, when he introduced the concept of relative time as part of his special theory of relativity. A search is now under way to confirm the suspected existence of particles of matter that move at a speed greater than light, and therefore, might serve as our passports to the past. An obsession with time - saving, gaining, wasting, losing and mastering it - seems to have been a part of humanity for as long as human have existed. Humanity also has been obsessed with trying to capture the meaning of time. Einstein used a definition of time for experimental purposes, as that which is measured by a clock. Thus time and time's relativity are measurable by any hour glass, alarm clock, or atomic clock that can measure a billionth of a second.
　　本文提要：
　　本篇属于科技类文章，主要围绕时间和运动的关系展开；用谚语开篇引出全文，很有吸引力。中间引用爱因斯坦的相对论相关概念，具体阐述主题。
　　答案：
　　36. survive
　　解析：文章描述：运动越快，时间变慢得也更快，这也就意味着宇航员有朝一日可以在太空中生存（survive）很久，如此一来他们就可以在遥远（distant）的未来重返地球。
　　37. distant
　　解析：这个空在future 前面，所以预判该填形容词常用搭配无非near，close， distant等 ，根据听力原文，如上所述，确定是遥远的未来；填distant。
　　38. backward
　　解析：速度达到光速，时间静止；根据常识推断，若速度快于光速，那么时间将后退，即move backward，根据听力原文可确定这一推断。
　　39. discovered
　　解析：空缺部分作后置定语，从音频可知是发现(discovered)，用其过去完成时态。
　　40. scientific
　　解析：该空后接名词，应为形容词，scientific。
　　41. motion
　　解析：
　　原文描述，实验已证明运动加快会使宇航员的时间延长。这里的运动为motion。
　　42. predicted
　　解析：爱因斯坦在1905年时作出预测，用过去时predicted。
　　43. introduced
　　解析：这是爱因斯坦提出的一个相对时间的概念，用过去时introduced。
　　44. that move at a speed greater than light, and therefore, might serve as our passports to the past.
　　解析：当下进行的研究旨在证实，是否有这样的物质，即能以超光速运行，并可以作为我们回归过去的“通行证”。填句只需意思相近就可以，关键抓住核心：超光速运行，可帮助人类回到过去。
　　45. seems to have been a part of humanity for as long as human have existed.
　　解析：人类对时间的节约，获取，浪费以及流失等的着迷，自人类诞生以来就一直是其生活的一部分。核心：人类诞生以来就一直存在的，如影随形的。
　　46. used a definition of time for experimental purposes, as that which is measured by a clock.
　　解析：人类也对时间的含义非常着迷，爱因斯坦就曾提出一个试验性的定义，这个定义下的时间可以用钟表来测量。核心意思：试验性的定义，可以用钟表来测量。

　　Section A
　　文章大意：
　　47 N tend
　　48 L negative
　　49 H efficiently
　　50 B associated
　　51 A alert
　　52 J function/
　　53 F definitely
　　54 O younger
　　55 E continuing
　　56 G different
　　文章大意：本文主要讲述的是关于老年人睡眠的问题：是否老年人与年轻人相比只需要较少的睡眠时间？
　　47. tend to 固定搭配；表示“倾向于；”符合句意；
　　48. 空格后是effect， 前面是a(n)， 由此可见，该处需要填入一个形容词；题目给出的形容词有negative, sufficient, younger；根据前后语意，填入negative最为恰当，表示“少的睡眠时间对大脑的活动有负面的影响。”
　　49. 根据推测，该处应该填入一个副词，题目给出的副词有efficiently, definitely, formally；前面提到，老年人在睡觉的时候更容易被打断，而后面用while提出一个对比的概念，年轻人相比起来能获得更_______ 的睡眠；综合起来，选用efficiently（最有效率的）最为准确。
　　50. be associated with 固定搭配；表示“与…联系在一起”；本句话表示“更多的睡眠通常都与健康度联系在一起”；
　　51. 先看整句话的含义，“如果他们能睡更长的时间，他们的感觉应该会更好以及…”那么，该处应该填入一个褒义词，选择alert比较恰当，表示“更加警觉，机灵”；
　　52. 根据判断，此处应该填入一个动词，剩下的动词有cling, function；整句话的意思是“当我们上了年纪的时候，我们一觉睡到天亮的能力下降了，但是，我们需要…的睡眠量并没有改变；”空格后的单词是well， cling 在这里并不合适，一般与to连用；选用function 最为适合；
　　53. 作者在首段已经提出这个观点是一个myth，那么显而易见最后一段中出现的myth是作为一种强调手段，应填入definitely；
　　54. 空格的前面是 when they were…， “当他们年轻的时候”；应填入younger；
　　55. 本句的意思是“我们的数据显示老年人将从…获益；”空格的后面是“得到和他们在三十多岁的时候能得到的睡眠一样多”；根据上下文意思，该处应填入“continuing”；
　　56. different from 固定搭配；表示“和…不同”；
　　总的说来，建议大家在做题之前对所给的所有词汇进行一下简单的词性分类，这样，更有助于考生快速有效地从最小的范围内选出答案。
　　Section B
　　Passage One
　　57. What can we learn from some recent studies?
　　答案：D. Interracial lodging may have diverse outcomes.
　　关键词：recent studies, but also
　　定位：题干中some recent studies提示答案定位在第一段第一句话。
　　解析：问题提问从最近的研究中我们可以了解到什么？第一段第一句中Several recent studies found that…与题干对应，由此可知that后的就是recent studies的内容，即being randomly assigned to a roommate of another race can lead to increased tolerance but also to a greater likelihood of conflict。其中“being randomly assigned to a roommate of another race”对应了选项D中的“interracial lodging”，“can… but also…”说明了interracial lodging是有利有弊的。因此D选项符合文意。而C选项“弊大于利”不符合文意, A“不同种族学生之间的争执是不可避免的”选项与B“不同种族的学生相互存在偏见”原文中没有明确提及
　　58. What does Sam Boakye's remark mean?
　　答案：D. Being surrounded by white peers motivates a black student to work harder to succeed.
　　关键词：surrounded, something to prove
　　定位：题干中出现的人名Sam Boakye提示答案定位在第四段第一句话。
　　解析：问题提问Sam Boakye的话是什么意思？通过定位可以找到Sam Boakye的那段话，即if you're surrounded by whites, you have something to prove. 这句话前面的插入语-the only black student on his freshman year floor- 介绍了Sam Boakye作为黑人学生的背景，帮助我们理解之前那句话：如果你的周围都是白人，那么一定会去证明些什么，言下之意就是选项D“白人同伴的存在会激励黑人学生更加努力地去取得成功”。而选项A, B, C在文中没有明确提及。本题选项C有个干扰信息“the freshman year”，在原文中出现。某些考生看到这个词，不假思索就选择了这个选项，但没有搞懂原文的意思，导致错误选择。请考生留意。
　　59. What does the Indian University study show?
　　答案：A. Interracial roommates are more likely to fall out.
　　关键词：Indian University, more likely,
　　定位：题干中出现的机构名称Indian University提示答案定位在第七段第一句话。
　　解析：问题提问Indian University的研究显示了什么？通过定位可以发现研究结果显示Interracial roommate were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together，与选项A中的more likely to fall out 对应，因此选择D。此处，fall out 应该理解为“散伙，分开”有些考生可能因为不理解意思而产生歧义，请考生留意。
　　60. What does Alec Webley consider to be the “definition of integration”?
　　答案：D. The school randomly assigns roommates without regard to race.
　　关键词：Alec Webley, definition of integration
　　定位：题干出现的人名Alec Webley提示答案定位在第十段第一句。
　　解析：通过定位找到人名，人名后出现“This is the definition of integration”，由“this”可知人名前就是我们要找的答案，即the process throws you together randomly，“throw you together randomly”与“randomly assign”对应。意思与选项D符合。因此，此处选择D。
　　61. What does Grace Kao say about interracial lodging?
　　答案：A. It is unscientific to make generalizations about it without further study.
　　关键词：Grace Kao, generalizations
　　定位：题干中出现的人名Grace Kao以及generalizations提示答案定位在文章最后一段。根据最后一段意思：要得出Interracial lodging的一般规律，需要对学生的背景特征有更多的研究，与选项D的意思相同。而选项ABC在文中没有明确提及。
　　Passage Two
　　本篇文章主要是围绕一份来自Global Humanitarian Forum的报告展开的，在解题之前，通过对5个题干的浏览，以及在原文中的定位，可以发现，这篇文章是严格按照顺序原则来出题的。每一个题干中都有大写的字母，这些首字母大写的单词既是关键词，也是定位词，可以有效地帮助我们到原文中准确定位，节省答题时间。
　　62. What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?
　　答案：B. Rates of death from illnesses have risen due to global warming.
　　关键词：Global Humanitarian Forum
　　定位：第一段、第二段
　　解析：一般而言，四级的阅读题目大致遵循顺序原则，此篇文章正好是遵循此规律的。在文章的第一段，第一行，我们看到“… 300,000 deaths and about $ 125 billion …”,根据这里，我们可以把答案锁定在选项A（economic）和选项B (Rates of death)，然后我们接着往下看，可以发现，第二段就没有再提到金钱方面了，而都是在讲死亡和疾病的话题，如第二段的第三行“… death rates from illnesses … ”。所以，最后正确的选项是B。
　　63. What do we learn about the Forum's report from the passage?
　　答案：A. It was challenged by some climate and risk experts.
　　关键词：learn 、Forum's report
　　定位：第三段
　　解析：根据顺序原则，我们在接下来的第三段里就找到了63题的答案。第三段的第一行就讲到“the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk”，这和A选项是完全相一致的，challenged是criticism的同义替换。B选项中的“interest”表示“兴趣”，主要用于好的事物，这里讲的都是对the Forum's repor的批评，显然就不合适了。C选项表达的意思跟原文正好相反，这个是肯定要排除的。然后，有的同学可能会选到D选项，可能是受到文中第四段“… primarily in poor countries ,were being seriously effected …”这句话的影响。但是D选项中“a big stir”“一阵巨大的骚乱”文中是完全没有提到的。
　　64. What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum's report?
　　答案：B. It is invalid in terms of methodology.
　　关键词：Dr. Pielke、say
　　定位：第五段
　　解析：在第五段，我们可以很快找到Pielke，然后找到他说的话，第二行“the Forum's report was ‘a methodological embarrassment'”,然后在第六行“but the report, he said‘will harm the … it is so deeply flawed'”。根据这两句话，选项中invalid 是flawed的同义替换， 我们可以很容易地选到B。
　　65. What is Soren Andreasen's view of the report?
　　答案：D. Its rough estimates are meant to draw the attention of world leaders.
　　关键词：Soren Andreasen
　　定位：第六段
　　解析：在第六段的第二行和第三行，可以看到“the number were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders … ”,根据这两句话，我们就能较轻松地将正确答案锁定在D选项。
　　66. What does Kofi Annan say should be the focus of the Copenhagen conference?

　　答案：D. How rich countries can better help poor regions reduce climate hazards.
　　关键词：Kofi Annan、focus of the Copenhagen conference
　　定位：第七段（即文中的最后一段）
　　解析：最后一段是Kofi Annan说的一段话。我们在最后一段的第二行，focus on后面“… from rich to poor regions to help reduce … ”后面的内容就无需再花时间去看了，因为他focus（关注）的地方，在此就已经陈述清楚了，正确答案就是D。

　　这是一篇关于科学饮食的科技新闻。
　　为了让学生快速进入语境，文章第一段没有挖空。
　　从第一段中，我们可以获得全文主旨：科学饮食的真谛是从大处着眼，
　　67. 第二段首句有个定语从句：科学饮食远不止分析每一口放到嘴里的饭。这里要选择一个介词，lift 的原意是高举，在这里的意思就是“放到嘴边”，to 表示方向。 between 表示在某某之间，不合题意。inside 表示静态，与lift这个动作相矛盾。同理，B选项through，表示穿过，lift这个动作，到嘴边就结束了，并没有穿过嘴巴。
　　68. 按照原文的逻辑，接下来的一句话，表达过去人们如何如何，是为了给出“靶子”加以批评，所以，我们需要继续往后读，读到作者提倡的做法，然后反向理解一下，便可选出答案。
　　69. 根据语法搭配，只有key才可以和后面的to相搭配，所以选择A选项。
　　70. 句首的but，是题眼，表达对比之意，所以，下文开始讲述“另一种”“不同的”饮食习惯。因此，选择B选项，different。
　　71. 这里是个不定式短语，需要一个动词，由宾语heart disease可知，“prevent”（预防）是最佳搭配。
　　72. 考察和general搭配的介词，只有in 符合语法。
　　73. 需要一个动词和on搭配，语法上四个选项都可以搭配，只能从词义上判断，turn on 表示打开，focus on 表示注重，put on 表示穿衣，carry on 表示执行。根据宾语，“更广的层面”，可知应该选择focus on。
　　74. 需要一个和“时间段”搭配的介词，over a period of time 表示一段时间以来，符合题意。
　　75. 这里表示“是什么而不是什么”，应该用rather than 才能准确达意。
　　76. 这是个分词短语作后置定语修饰前面的“this or that”，这里的this or that代指食物。convey是表达，不搭配。enter 可以表示“输入，记下”，也不和食物搭配。和食物搭配的只有B和D，consume表示，消费或消耗。exhaust 表示耗尽。很明显，这里的食物并不会耗尽，所以只能选B选项。
　　这里我们可以回过头来，看一下第68题，文章的主旨是，“Scientist now focus on the broader picture of the balance of food eaten over several days or a week”即“科学家现在注重最近几天内的均衡饮食”，与此能够形成对比的，“单个营养元素的定量摄入”，这里能表达特定量的词只有“certain”或者“specific”，这里用certain更自然，但是没有提供选项，因此就只能选择specific，表示“特定的”。
　　77. 需要个形容词，做后置定语，和for good health 搭配，这里只有vital 能和for搭配，表示“对…重要”。
　　78. 这里是一个 The more…the more 的固定表达，表示“越……越……”，这里用amazed表达科研人员，对新发现所产生的“惊奇之感”。
　　79. 这里的they表示食物，结合后面的动词，构成定语从句，修饰“必备营养元素”，这里的用contain才能准确达意，“食物包含必备营养元素”
　　80. 需要一个动词和with搭配，只能选择A和B，但从语义上判断，必备营养元素之间会相互反应，肯定不会相互干扰。因此只能选择interact。
　　81. 这里需要一个介词和track搭配，只有 on the right track才符合语法
　　82. 这里根据题意，“蔬菜、水果和谷物构成了饭菜的四分之三”，这里make up表达“构成”之意。
　　83. 这里需要一个动词，宾语是“剩余的四分之一”，从语义上理解，我们需要选择“填充”，因此，fill in 是符合语法的。

　　84. 这里需要一个动词，结合题意，这个空应该表达“不吃”，才能和前面的eat形成对比，这里的avoid，表达避免的意思，比delete（删除）更切题。
　　85. 文章在最后一句，要下一个结论，这里用without a doubt 表达“毫无疑问”，符合题目要求。
　　86. 这里需要一个名词，和on搭配，只有impact符合题意。
　　总之，今年四级的完型填空，涉及3处名词，5处介词，7处动词，4处形容词和1处副词。
　　只有1题（第68题）需要整体把握，其余部分只要在句子内部或者句子之间进行上下文逻辑比对或语法搭配，即可完成。
　　Part VI Translation
　　87. The university authorities did not approve the regulation, nor did they make any explanation / nor did they give the reason for doing so (也没有解释为什么).
　　解析：本题考察了两个知识点。① nor的倒装句用法，后半句表示“也不”的否定意义，注意助动词的时态与上半句保持一致；② 对某事做出解释的表达，考察了汉译英中动词转名词的技巧，explain → explanation，或者nor did they give the reason for doing so同样可以。
　　88. Jane is tired of dealing with customer complaints and wishes that she could be assigned (to) another job（能被分配做另一项工作）
　　解析：本题考察了wish从句的虚拟语气用法（can→could）和“分配某人做某事”的词组搭配，assign sb. to sth. 或者assign sb. sth.
　　89. John rescued the drowning child at the risk of his own life (冒着自己生命危险).
　　解析：本题考察了“冒着…的危险/风险做某事”的词组搭配，可以用at the risk / expense of one's own life（冒着某人的生命危险做某事）
　　90. George called his boss from the airport but it ① was his assistant who answered / picked up the phone；② turned out that his assistant answered / picked up the phone（接电话的却是他的助手）
　　解析：该句比较灵活，在句法上，既可以使用强调句结构，也可以采用turn out的惯用搭配；在“接电话”的表达上，可以用pick up / answer the phone。强调句结构为it be sb. who do sth. ,而turn out变化则较多，可以用turn out to be sb. who do sth.或者turn out + that + 从句。

　　91. Although he was interested in philosophy, his father persuaded him into / talked him into（他的父亲说服他）majoring in law.
　　解析：本题考察“说服某人做某事”的表达，persuade / talk sb. into doing sth.
　　整体评价：今年6月的翻译题难度适中，89和91题的词组搭配是拿分题，而87题的倒装结构和88题的虚拟语气用法也是广大四级考生的“老朋友”，不熟悉实在说不过去。

A Grassroots Remedy
Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers (慢跑者) jog, they don’t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.
But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, South London. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.
The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.
A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.
Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy (等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.
Most bullying (恃强凌弱) is found in schools where there is a tarmac (柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.
But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.
One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.
The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.
In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.
Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, “A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour.” Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.
We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.
Human beings are a species of mammals (哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.
We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.
Five ways to find harmony with the natural world
Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.
Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that’s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.
Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.
Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.
Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home. It lasts forever, after all.

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
What determines the kind of person you are? What factors make you more or less bold, intelligent, or able to read a map? All of these are influenced by the interaction of your genes and the environment in which you were 47 . The study of how genes and environment interact to influence 48 activity is known as behavioral genetics. Behavioral genetics has made important 49 to the biological revolution, providing information about the extent to which biology influences mind, brain and behavior.
Any research that suggests that 50 to perform certain behaviors are based in biology is controversial. Who wants to be told that there are limitations to what you can 51 based on something that is beyond your control, such as your genes? It is easy to accept that genes control physical characteristics such as sex, race and eye color. But can genes also determine whether people will get divorced, how 52 they are, or what career they are likely to choose? A concern of psychological scientists is the 53 to which all of these characteristics are influenced by nature and nurture(养育), by genetic makeup and the environment. Increasingly, science 54 that genes lay the groundwork for many human traits. From this perspective, people are born 55 like undeveloped photographs: The image is already captured, but the way it 56 appears can vary based on the development process. However, the basic picture is there from the beginning.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
It is pretty much a one-way street. While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia (学术界) outweigh any financial considerations.
Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the University of Cambridge. Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee’s is one of them.
The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical (制药的) company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities.
Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition (转换) to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development. “Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career. So someone leaving university who already has the skills needed to work in an industrial lab has far more potential in the job market than someone who has spent all their time on a narrow research project.”

57. By “a one-way street” (Line 1, Para. 1), the author means ________.
[A] university researchers know little about the commercial world
[B] there is little exchange between industry and academia
[C] few industrial scientists would quit to work in a university
[D] few university professors are willing to do industrial research
58. The word “deterrent” (Line 2, Para. 1) most probably refers to something that ________.
[A] keeps someone from taking action [C] attracts people’s attention
[B] helps to move the traffic [D] brings someone a financial burden
59. What was Helen Lee’s major consideration when she changed her job in the middle of her career?
[A] Flexible work hours. [C] Her preference for the lifestyle on campus.
[B] Her research interests. [D] Prospects of academic accomplishments.

[A] do financially more rewarding work
[B] raise his status in the academic world
[C] enrich his experience in medical research
[D] exploit better intellectual opportunities

[A] Increase its graduates’ competitiveness in the job market.
[B] Develop its students’ potential in research.
[C] Help it to obtain financial support from industry.
[D] Gear its research towards practical applications.
Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity (长寿) boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers (鳏夫) were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man’s life and two to a woman’s. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.
Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.
So how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological (生理的) mechanisms. For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.
A life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100. The ultimate social network is still being mapped out, but Christakis says: “People are interconnected, so their health is interconnected.”

[A] social life provides an effective cure for illness
[B] being sociable helps improve one’s quality of life
[C] women benefit more than men from marriage
[D] marriage contributes a great deal to longevity
63. Linda Waite’s studies support the idea that _________.
[A] older men should quit smoking to stay healthy
[B] marriage can help make up for ill health
[C] the married are happier than the unmarried
[D] unmarried people are likely to suffer in later life
64. It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 4, Para. 2) refers to _________.
[A] the disadvantages of being married
[B] the emotional problems arising from marriage
[C] the responsibility of taking care of one’s family
[D] the consequence of a broken marriage
65. What does the author say about social networks?
[A] They have effects similar to those of a marriage.
[B] They help develop people’s community spirit.
[C] They provide timely support for those in need.
[D] They help relieve people of their life’s burdens.
66. What can be inferred from the last paragraph?
[A] It’s important that we develop a social network when young.

Help Children to Be Independent

Thanks to the “family plan”policy,today in China many families have one child.Loving and caring for children is an old Chinese tradition that has remained for thousands of years.But the children are spoilt so much that they have less independence.They rely on their parents in everything.That is bad for a child's growing.Therefore,parents should develop the children's independence instead of doing everything for them.
There are some ways to help children to be independent.First of all,you should believe your children can do the things well.Second,give them more chances to practise,when they don't know how to do it,just tell them the way.Third,don't be afraid to see them fail.In the beginning,they may do something bad.But don't worry,just let them try again.They can do the work as well as you if given more time.
To be independent is good for the children.A child who is independent will succeed easily in the future.

Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes)
　　Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.
　　Caught in the Web
　　A few months ago, it wasn't unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She'd wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs – leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem.
　　"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart – kind of slipping into a depression," said Carla. "I knew that if I didn't get off the dating sites, I'd just keep going," detaching (使脱离) herself further from the outside world.
　　Toebe's conclusion: She felt like she was "addicted" to the Internet. She's not alone.
　　Concern about excessive Internet use isn't new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There's still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible.
　　But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web.
　　"There's no question that there're people who're seriously in trouble because they're overdoing their Internet involvement," said psychiatrist (精神科医生) Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction.
　　Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. "The Internet is an environment," he said. "You can't be addicted to the environment." Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online.
　　The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that "their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use." About 9% attempted to conceal "nonessential Internet use," and nearly 4% reported feeling "preoccupied by the Internet when offline."
　　About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they "found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time."
　　"The Internet problem is still in its infancy," said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use, he said. "They're online in chat rooms, checking e-mail, or writing blogs. [The problem is] not limited to porn (色情) or gambling" websites.
　　Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but "in terms of losses," said Maressa Orzack, a Harvard University professor. "If it's a loss [where] you're not getting to work, and family relationships are breaking down as a result, then it's too much."
　　Since the early 1990s, several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior.
　　The website for Orzack's center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction:
　　● Having a sense of well-being (幸福) or excitement while at the computer.
　　● Longing for more and more time at the computer.
　　● Neglect of family and friends.
　　● Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer.
　　● Lying to employers and family about activities.
　　● Inability to stop the activity.
　　● Problems with school or job.
　　Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes, backaches, skipping meals, poor personal hygiene (卫生) and sleep disturbances.
　　People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders, Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients, they often report that being online offers a "sense of belonging, and escape, excitement [and] fun," she said. "Some people say relief…because they find themselves so relaxed."
　　Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game, called World of Warcraft, is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a "gaming addiction."
　　Andrew Heidrich, an education network administrator from Sacramento, plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night, but that's nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention (干预), in which relatives told him he'd gained weight.
　　"There's this whole culture of competition that sucks people in" with online gaming, said Heidrich, now a father of two. "People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives." Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly "to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check."
　　Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August, when she first realized she had a problem, she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line: "I have an Internet Addiction."
　　"I'm self-employed and need the Internet for my work, but I'm failing to accomplish my work,to take care of my home, to give attention to my children," she wrote in a message sent to the group."I have no money or insurance to get professional help; I can't even pay my mortgage (抵押贷款) and face losing everything."
　　Since then, Toebe said, she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. "I have a boyfriend now, and I'm not interested in online dating," she said by phone last week. "It's a lot better now."

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 million existing homes, and it would be __47__ wasteful to tear them all down and __48__ them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __49__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest __50__, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and __51__ our homes, offices and other buildings. "You can't deal with climate change without dealing with existing buildings," says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　　With some __52__, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that __53__ over time and let in more outside air.
　　Fortunately, there are a __54__ number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from __55__ ones like Lincoln's Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help __56__ property owners from rising power costs.

Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　You never see him, but they're with you every time you fly. They record where you are going,how fast you're traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book.They're known as the black box.
　　When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the India ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device's homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.
　　In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first mode for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane – the area least subject to impact – from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). The same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.
　　Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations,and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　57. What does the author say about the black box?
　　A) It ensures the normal functioning of an airplane.
　　B) The idea for its design comes from a comic book.
　　C) Its ability to ward off disasters is incredible.
　　D) It is an indispensable device on an airplane.
　　58. What information could be found from the black box on the Yemeni airliner?
　　A) Data for analyzing the cause of the crash.
　　B) The total number of passengers on board.
　　C) The scene of the crash and extent of the damage.
　　D) Homing signals sent by the pilot before the crash.
　　59. Why was the black box redesigned in 1965?
　　A) New materials became available by that time.
　　B) Too much space was needed for its installation.
　　C) The early models often got damaged in the crash.
　　D) The early models didn't provide the needed data.
　　60. Why did the Federal Aviation Authority require the black boxes be painted orange or yellow?
　　A) To distinguish them from the colour of the plane.
　　B) To caution people to handle them with care.
　　C) To make them easily identifiable.
　　D) To conform to international standards.
　　61. What do we know about the black boxes from Air France Flight 447?
　　A) There is still a good chance of their being recovered.
　　B) There is an urgent need for them to be reconstructed.
　　C) They have stopped sending homing signals.
　　D) They were destroyed somewhere near Brazil.
Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?
　　Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.
　　The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.
　　In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable."
　　Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.
　　The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2 上作答。
　　62. What do we learn from the first paragraph about the self-help industry?
　　A) It is a highly profitable industry.
　　B) It is based on the concept of positive thinking.
　　C) It was established by Norman Vincent Peale.
　　D) It has yielded positive results.
　　63. What is the finding of the Canadian researchers?
　　A) Encouraging positive thinking many do more harm than good.
　　B) There can be no simple therapy for psychological problems.
　　C) Unhappy people cannot think positively.
　　D) The power of positive thinking is limited.
　　64. What does the author mean by "… you're just underlining his faults" (Line 4, Para. 3)?
　　A) You are not taking his mistakes seriously enough.
　　B) You are pointing out the errors he has committed.
　　C) You are emphasizing the fact that he is not intelligent.
　　D) You are trying to make him feel better about his faults.
　　65. What do we learn from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic?
　　A) It is important for people to continually boost their self-esteem.
　　B) Self-affirmation can bring a positive change to one's mood.
　　C) Forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self-esteem.
　　D) People with low self-esteem seldom write down their true feelings.
　　66. What do we learn from the last paragraph?
　　A) The effects of positive thinking vary from person to person.
　　B) Meditation may prove to be a good form of psychotherapy.
　　C) Different people tend to have different ways of thinking.
　　D) People can avoid making mistakes through meditation.

　　Due Attention Should Be Given To Spelling
　　Correct spelling is a basic skill in English study. However, nowadays many students do not pay much attention to it.
　　They have their own reasons for misspelling. First of all, they like an easy way of studying, which causes some omissions and changes in spelling. Second, the teachers might not be very strict in students’ spelling. In China, teachers seem to be more concerned with grammar and vocabulary but not spelling.
　　To change this situation, in my opinion, the teachers and the students should work together. On one and, the teachers should give more attention to students’ spelling, asking the students to be conscious of the importance of correct spelling from the very beginning of their English study. On the other hand, the students themselves are supposed to be aware that correct spelling is a must in English study.
　　To sum up, correct spelling is so important that both students and the teachers should spare no efforts to achieve correct spelling.

Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid
　　Good grades and high tests scores still matter—a lot—to many colleges as they award financial aid.
　　But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as “merit aid”, is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars.
　　George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients(接受者), pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.
　　Now, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.
　　Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don’t meet need eligibility(资格)have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.
　　For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running.
　　But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. “They’re trying to buy students,” says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum.
　　Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.
　　“As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,” says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report’s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.
　　Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, “served us well,” Inzer says, but “to be discounting the price for families that don’t need financial aid doesn’t feel right any more.”
　　Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.
　　Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state’s public institutions.
　　But in recent years, a growing chorus(异口同声)of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be “a sign that people are starting to realize that there’s this destructive competition going on,” says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.
　　David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.
　　“No one can take one-sided action,” says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption(豁免)from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, “This is a merry-go-round that’s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.”
　　A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don’t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.
　　That’s one reason Allegheny College doesn’t plan to drop merit aid entirely.
　　“We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,” says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny’s vice president for enrollment.
　　Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment(捐赠), meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.
　　“Yeah, we’re playing the merit game,” acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. “The fact of the matter is, it’s not just about the lowest-income people. It’s the average American middle-class family who’s being priced out of the market.”
　　*A few words about merit-based aid:
　　Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.
　　Academic merit scholarships are based on students’ grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. 
　　Athletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel(突出)in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee(裁判). Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance.
　　Artistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio(选辑)of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　In families with two working parents, fathers may have more impact on a child’s language development than mothers, a new study suggests.
　　Researchers 47 92 families form 11 child care centers before their children were a year old, interviewing each to establish income, level of education and child care arrangements. Overall, it was a group of well-class families, with married parents both living in the home.
　　When the children were 2, researchers videotaped them at home in free-play sessions with both parents, 48 all of their speech. The study will appear in the November issue of The Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.
　　The scientists measured the 49 number of utterance (话语) of the parents, the number of different words they used, the complexity of their sentences and other 50 of their speech. On average, fathers spoke less than mothers did, but they did not differ in the length of utterances or proportion of questions asked.
　　Finally, the researchers 51 the children’s speech at age 3, using a standardized language test. The only predictors of high scores on the test were the mother’s level of education, the 52 of child care and the number of different words the father used. 
　　The researchers are 53 why the father’s speech, and not the mother’s, had an effect.
　　“It’s well 54 that the mother’s language does have an impact,” said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the study. It could be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had 55 had a strong influence on their children’s speech development, Ms. Pancsofar said, “or it may be that mothers are 56 in a way we didn’t measure in the study.”

Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Throughout this long, tense election, everyone has focused on the presidential candidates and how they’ll change America. Rightly so, but selfishly, I’m more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an African-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world’s attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.
　　Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we’re all hot-tempered single mothers who can’t keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can’t escape the stereotype of being eye-rolling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic (酗酒的) mothers.
　　These images have helped define the way all women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simple to be herself.
　　It won’t be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.
　　Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-American blogs have written about what they’d like to see Michelle bring to the White House—mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone—an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that’s been around for far too long.
　　57. Why does Michelle Obama hold a strong fascination for the author?
　　A) She serves as a role model for African women.
　　B) She possesses many admirable qualities becoming a First Lady.
　　C) She will present to the world a new image of African-American women.
　　D) She will pay closer attention to the interests of African-American women.
　　58. What is the common stereotype of African-American women according to the author?
　　A) They are victims of violence. B) They are of an inferior violence.
　　C) They use quite a lot of body language. D) They live on charity and social welfare.
　　59. What do many African-Americans write about in their blogs?
　　A) Whether Michelle can live up to the high expectations of her fans.
　　B) How Michelle should behave as a public figure.
　　C) How proud they are to have a black woman in the White House.
　　D) What Michelle should do as wife and mother in the White House.
　　60. What does the author say about Michelle Obama as a First Lady?
　　A) However many fans she has, she should remain modest,
　　B) She shouldn’t disappoint the African-American community.
　　C) However hard she tries, she can’t expect to please everybody.
　　D) She will give priority to African-American women’s concerns.
　　61. What do many African-American women hope Michelle Obama will do?
　　A) Help change the prevailing view about black women.
　　B) Help her husband in the task of changing America.
　　C) Outshine previous First Lady.
　　D) Fully display her fine qualities.
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　When next year’s crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they’ll be joined by a new face; Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who’ll become Oxford’s vice-chancellor—a position equivalent to university president in America.
　　Hamilton isn’t the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc, have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it’s gone global. Yet the talent flow isn’t universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.
　　The chief reason is that American schools don’t tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university’s budget. “We didn’t do any global consideration,” says Patricia Hayes, the board’s chair. The board ultimately picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.
　　Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student number. The decline in government support has made funding-raising an increasing necessary ability among administrators and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.
　　In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen “a major strengthening of Yale’s financial position.”
　　Of course, fund-raising isn’t the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind of promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.
　　62. What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?
　　A) Institutions worldwide are hiring administrators from the U.S.
　　B) A lot of political activists are being recruited as administrators.
　　C) American universities are enrolling more international students.
　　D) University presidents are paying more attention to funding-raising.
　　63. What is the chief consideration of American universities when hiring top-level administrators?
　　A) The political correctness. B) Their ability to raise funds.
　　C) Their fame in academic circles. D) Their administrative experience.
　　64. What do we learn about European universities from the passage?
　　A) The tuitions they charge have been rising considerably.
　　B) Their operation is under strict government supervision.
　　C) They are strengthening their position by globalization.
　　D) Most of their revenues come from the government.
　　65. Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard as its vice-chancellor chiefly because _____.
　　A) she was known to be good at raising money
　　B) she could help strengthen its ties with Yale
　　C) she knew how to attract students overseas
　　D) she had boosted Yale’s academic status
　　66. In what way do top-level administrators from abroad contribute to university development?
　　A) They can enhance the university’s image.
　　B) They will bring with them more international faculty.
　　C) They will view a lot of things from a new perspective.
　　D) They can set up new academic disciplines.

　　The current people approach which 67 on younger people and on skills for employment is not 68 to meet the challenges of demographic (人口结构的) change, it says. Only 1% of the education budget is 69 spent on the oldest third of the population.

　　Creating a Green Campus
　　Recently, with the idea of making and maintaining “a green earth” being the focus of the society, “green campus” has become a more and more popular concept in universities or colleges, which, undoubtedly, will bring us an ever-lasting benefit to both our campus and our society.
　　The concept of “green campus” does not only mean a green environment but also refers to an environmental sense in people’s mind. Campus plays a crucial role in educating the young generation and the consciousness of “green campus” will definitely produce a profound effect on students’ various environmental protection activities after their graduation. What’s more, the young generation is under the burden of severe environmental pollution and there are many problems waiting for them to solve.
　　To make “green campus” come true, firstly, it is necessary to work out effective principles for the development of sustainable and recyclable campus. Secondly, it calls for people’s awareness of the serious pollution around us and actual action to reduce the waste. Last but not least, it is necessary to strengthen the ties between campus and society, so as to ensure that “green campus” can work smoothly with the co-effort of the whole society.
　　建设绿色校园
　　近来，随着建设并保持“绿色地球”的观念成为社会关注的焦点，“绿色校园”也成为校园里流行的话题。这无疑会给我们的校园和社会带来长远的利益。
　　“绿色校园”不仅仅指绿色的环境，还包括人们头脑中的环境意识。学校在培养年轻一代上起着关键作用，“绿色校园”的意识必定会对学生毕业后的环境保护意识产生长远影响。更为重要的是，年轻一代面临着严重的环境污染，有太多问题等待他们去解决。
　　为使“绿色校园”成为现实，首先应该制定出可持续发展、可长远发展的有效政策。其次，还需要人们对环境污染的严肃性有正确认识并采取实际行动切实减少污染。最后但同样重要的是，有必要加强学校和社会的联系以便在全社会共同努力下使“绿色校园”顺利实施。
　　范文点评
　　范文以“绿色校园”开篇，保证了文章切题。第一段开门见山，强调当今环保理念下构建“绿色校园”的长远意义。第二段，着重讨论“绿色校园”的含义，指出“绿色校园”不仅指校园中的绿化，还指生活在校园中的人们的绿色和环保意识，把校园这个小环境和社会这个大环境结合起来，说理更加深刻。第三段是谈及具体的做法，分一、二、三点进行论述，无疑是使“绿色校园”的理念落在实处。结构完整，首尾呼应，用词准确。关系词的正确使用让句与句之间、段与段之间衔接紧凑，思想表达成熟有深度。
　　【生动的用词】 maintain保持;concept概念;profound长远的;sustainable可持续的;recyclable可循环的。
　　【丰富的短语】bring benefit to带来利益;play a crucial role in发挥关键作用;under the burden of在……重负下;come true实现;call for要求。
　　【多变的句式】
　　范文中长句、短句、简单句、复杂句交叉使用。不同句型之间的转换，能让阅卷老师更好地了解考生对句子结构的掌握运用，从而获得高分。
　　避错指导
　　本次作文在题材上，虽然仍然延续了我们所熟悉校园类话题，但与社会背景有很大关系。刚刚闭幕的哥本哈根世界气候大会使环保减排这个主题成为焦点，在全世界都提倡可持续发展、和谐发展这一背景下的“绿色校园”，同时也是一个社会热点话题，这是我们审题时所必须考虑的。另外开篇时，切忌拖泥带水，应直截了当，使阅卷老师对文章主题一目了然。
　　除正确审题之外，考生还应注意语言的准确运用，不落俗套。不同句型之间转换时，考生应对句子结构全面掌握，避免句式错误造成扣分。
　　最后，应尽量避免单词拼写错误。本次作文常见的卷面拼写错误如下表：
　　正确拼写 词性及词义 错误的拼写
　　focus n. 焦点 focuse
　　effect n. 影响 effection /affect
　　environment n. 环境 envirment/invironment
　　burden n. 负担 burdon
　　solve v. 解决 slove
　　serious a. 严肃的 serous
　　true a. 真的 ture
　　society n. 社会 soceity
　　theory n. 理论 thery
　　总之，考生在构思和写作过程中要尽可能做到思路完整，恰如其分地选择词汇。毕竟，无错表达才是四级语言表达合格的核心。
　　能力拓展

Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.”题目中的D项It cut its merit-based aid help the needy students与原文cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients, pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid意思相同，所以答案为D。

　　全文精译
　　大学重新审视奖学金的价值
　　许多大学给予学生经济资助时，最重要的依据仍然是学生良好的评估等级和较高的试卷分数。
　　但是在未来几年里，预计低收入家庭的学生数占大学生总数的比例越来越大。一些学校正在重新考虑奖学金是否是利用大学宝贵的资金最有效的途径。
　　例如，华盛顿特区的乔治?华盛顿大学上周公布说将削减约三分之一的奖学金，减少奖学金得主数，而将节省下来的大约250万美元用于助学金。位于宾夕法尼亚州米德维尔的阿勒格尼学院三年前也做出了类似的决定。
　　纽约克林顿市的哈密尔顿学院说它将逐步淘汰奖学金。该规定不会使现有的奖学金得主失去奖学金，助学金制度将从2008年秋天入学的学生开始实行。
　　并不是所有的大学都提供奖学金;一般来说，淘汰率越高的学校，越不太可能提供奖学金。例如，哈佛大学和普林斯顿大学慷慨地提供了各种助学金，但是许多不符合助学条件的家庭为了上名牌大学不管付多少钱都愿意。
　　对于规模较小的地方性学院来说，他们只是努力填满空缺，奖学金只是财政收入的重要来源，因为许多奖学金得主仍需支付比奖学金金额更高的学费，而正是这些学费维持大学的运转。
　　但是对于有排名意识的学校，奖学金已经成为招收一流学生和改善他们的学术效益的一种主要工具。斯基德莫尔大学的经济学家桑迪?波美说，“他们试图购买学生”。
　　研究表明奖学金存在一种倾向，即大部分奖学金得主不依靠奖学金仍能支付得起学费。
　　“展望未来，更迫切需要的助学金投资”，汉密尔顿的入学和助学金办公室主任莫尼卡?英泽说。汉密尔顿大学已提供10年的奖学金。在这段时间里，在《美国新闻和世界报导》对最好的文学院的排名中，它从第25名上升到第17名。
　　奖学金每年帮助了大约75名学生，或大约4%的学生，花费大约为一年1百万美元，“奖学金给我们带来了好处”，英泽说，但“奖学金这种变相优惠学费的做法对不需要经济援助的家庭来说，似乎不妥。”
　　助学金目前仍是学生接受资助的主要方式，包括国家助学金、联邦助学金和机构助学金。但是，从总体上和大学层面上来看，主要由学校和州提供的奖学金增长速度很快。
　　一项由美国宾州州立大学教授唐纳德?海勒主持的研究报告表明，在1995-96和2003-04年之间，仅就大学的奖学金而言，增加了212%，而助学金增加了47%。至少有15个州也提供奖学金，通常是为了在公立大学中招收优等生。
　　但是近年来，越来越多的批评已经迫使大学开始减少这种做法。汉密尔顿和其他大学最近的决策可能是“一种迹象，表明人们开始意识到这种破坏性的竞争”，波美说。波美与他人合作，共同发表了一份《大学报告》，对于大学资助不是建立在需要的基础之上表示担忧。
　　明尼苏达私立大学委员会主席大卫?莱尔德认为，很多私立学校想减少奖学金，但害怕这样做，会使优秀学生流失到他们的竞争对手那里去。
　　“没有人可以采取单方面行动，”莱尔德说。他正在探索是否能获得联邦反托拉斯法的豁免，以使会员大学可以讨论如何共同降低奖学金。“这是一个跑得很快的旋转木马，没有大学相信他们能承受摆脱木马束缚的风险。”
　　一个复杂因素就是，奖学金已经在不符合助学金条件的中产阶级家庭中变得很受欢迎，结果许多家庭都依靠它。并且，随着学费不断增加，奖助学金之间的界限也变得模糊了。
　　这是阿勒格尼大学并不打算完全取消奖学金的理由之一。
　　“我们仍然相信对成绩优异者进行奖励的效用，好学生很重视奖学金”， 阿勒格尼大学负责招生的副校长斯科特?弗利达霍夫说。
　　位于亚特兰大的艾莫利大学以拥有47亿美元的捐赠而自豪。同时该校拟采取新政策。今年，该大学宣布将取消特困生贷款，同时对中产阶级家庭的贷款进行限额，但它将扩大其已有28年历史的奖学金项目。
　　“是的，我们在玩奖学金游戏，”负责大学本科教育的副院长汤姆兰?卡斯特承认。但这也有它的优势，他说，“事实上，这不仅仅关系到低收入人群，它还关系到无缘问津助学金、普通的美国中产阶级家庭。”
　　* 关于奖学金制度的几点补充
　　奖学金是向在某一领域杰出的学生提供的资助，通常是指学术、体育和艺术奖学金。
　　学术奖学金是以学生在高中阶段的分数，平均成绩和学术表现为基础。它们通常是专门为学生在高中毕业后直接进入大学而设置的。然而，还有为学习成绩格外突出的在校大学生准备的奖学金。这些奖学金通常帮助学生交纳学费，只要他们继续符合条件，每年都可以继续享受。某些情况下，学生在申请过程中可能需要学校或者一位教师推荐。
　　运动奖学金是为在任何一种体育运动中突出的学生设置的奖学金，从足球到田径项目。本奖学金必须有人推荐，因为杰出的运动表现必须得到教练或裁判的认可。申请者需要寄送包含他们最佳表现的一盘磁带。
　　艺术奖学金要求申请者在一定艺术领域有突出表现。一般包括创作领域，如艺术、设计、时装、音乐、舞蹈或写作。申请艺术奖学金，通常要求学生提供一个选辑，它可以包括艺术作品集、音乐表演录像或舞蹈的视频

　　D) Surprised. D) 惊奇的。
　　【听音指导】预读时可排除唯一的“积极”选项C。本题为加了“弦外之音” 意义解释题，同义替换是答案，此类题有较少的明显的语言点可以指示答案，难度较大。听音时关注说话者的语气。
　　【正确项分析】女士所谓的好消息是谈话的两个人都没有被炒鱿鱼。男士却既不兴奋，也没有表示怀疑，所以轻易排除选项B、C。因为他已经有点厌倦这份工作了，甚至想到要去辞职。与选项A意义相符。
　　【原文及译文】
　　W: Bill, have you heard the latest news? It appears we two won’t be laid off after all.
　　M: Oh, I’m somewhat tired of working here. I’ve been wondering whether I should resign. Anyway, the news seems to be good for you.
　　Q: How does the man feel about the news?
　　女士：比尔，知道最新消息吗?好像我俩都没有被炒鱿鱼。
　　男士：哦，我在这儿工作有些厌烦了，我一直在考虑我是否应该辞职。无论如何，这个消息对你来说是个好事。
　　问题：男士对新闻是怎么看的?
　　【词汇点拨】indifferent a. 漠不关心的;doubtful a. 持怀疑态度的;lay off 解雇;resign v.辞职;be tired of … 对……厌倦
Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
　　19. A) He prefers the smaller evening classes. A) 他更喜欢晚上的小班课程。
　　B) He has signed up for a day course. B) 他已经报名参加白天课程。
　　C) He has to work during the day. C) 他白天上班。
　　D) He finds the evening course cheaper. D) 他发现晚上课程更便宜。
　　【听音指导】预览选项，选项A、D讨论evening class，选项B讲述day course，立刻可推测此长对话与课程有关，且该课程有day class和evening class之分。从这四个选项暗含的意义推测，男士应偏重于evening class，可初步推测，此题考查男士选择evening class的原因。
　　【正确项分析】原文中男士明确说明it would have to be an evening course since I work during the day，关键词在于since，正所谓“因果必考”，选项C与原文相符。
　　20. A) Learn a computer language. A) 学习一门计算机语言。
　　B) Learn data processing. B) 学习数据处理。
　　C) Buy some computer software. C) 买一些电脑软件。
　　D) Buy a few course books. D) 买一些课本。
　　【听音指导】行为动作考查题，根据19题推测，本对话涉及报班，由本题四个选项可知，所报课程与电脑有关，因为前三项均与computer有关。可知选项D与其他三项明显不同，可初步排除。本题也为一细节题，在听力过程中，应适时记录相关信息。
　　【正确项分析】女士先提到了Have you taken any courses in data processing，在其后紧跟着又对其进行了解释data processing is a course you have to take before you can take computer programming。对于data processing在对话中重复出现，且与问题相符，故选择B选项。
　　21. A) Thursday evening, from 7:00 to 9:45. A) 周四晚，7点至9点45分。
　　B) From September 1 to New Year’s eve. B) 从9月1号至新年前夕。
　　C) Every Monday, lasting for 12 weeks. C) 每周一，持续12周。
　　D) Three hours a week, 45 hours in total. D) 一星期三小时，总共45小时。
　　【听音指导】由选项即可知本题考查数字的细节题，且考查的数字为持续的时间，初步推测为某一课程所持续的时间。所以如在听力过程中涉及数字都要作笔记，且应注意数字的上下文场景。
　　【正确项分析】对该问题的回答，信息较分散，最初提到了every Monday, from 7 to 9:45。接下来在let me see停顿之后出现答案12 weeks，from September 1 to Christmas eve. 整合以上信息，应选C。
　　【干扰项分析】选项A错在Thursday evening，原文中明确给出应该是Monday evening。选项B中的New Year’s eve也是偷梁换柱，应为Christmas eve。选项D涉及小计算，每晚3小时，持续12周，应大约总共36小时才正确。
　　22. A) What to bring for registration. A) 登记时需要带什么。
　　B) Where to attend the class. B) 到哪里去上课。
　　C) How he can get to Frost Hall. C) 去弗罗斯特大厅怎么走。
　　D) Whether he can use a check. D) 他是否能用支票。
　　【听音指导】根据“前二后二必考”原则，本题又为本对话的最后一题，此题必在文章后面出题。由四选项的形式可初步推测，本题考查的是问题的内容。
　　【正确项分析】本题的问题直截了当，在原文中男士给出了明确的提问，Is there anything that I should bring with me? 与选项A同义。
　　【干扰项分析】许多考生按照常理或主观臆测选定选项B，此项在原文中恰恰没有提到。原文中男士也明确表明I know how to get there，选项C是多余的。文中虽提到checkbook，是女士对男士问题的回答，而非男士的发问，故排除。

　　C) A professional manager. C) 职业经理。
　　D) A financial trader. D) 金融交易商。
　　【听音指导】本题为本长对话的第一题，出题点必在对话开始，由选项可知，本题涉及职业， 对于职业的考查也是前几年四级考试的重点。
　　【正确项分析】男士在文中明确提及trading in financial markets，根据同义推断原理，可推断该男士的职业是financial trader.
　　24. A) He can save on living expenses. A) 他可以节省生活费用。
　　B) He considers cooking creative. B) 他认为烹饪是具有创新性的。
　　C) He can enjoy healthier food. C) 他喜欢健康食物。
　　D) He thinks take-away is tasteless. D) 他觉得外带食品不好吃。
　　【听音指导】预览选项，可知选项A与其他三项明显不同，可初步排除。本题与食物或烹饪有关。所以在听音过程中，如提及cooking或food，应多加注意，适时记录。
　　【正确项分析】 听音过程中听到此句I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away，即可知答案就在附近，接下来的一句To do something my brain will regard as creative中，出现了关键词creative，选项B与之相符，故选择B选项。
　　25. A) It is something inevitable. A) 是某种不可避免的事情。
　　B) It is frustrating sometimes. B) 有时候令人沮丧。
　　C) It takes patience to manage. C) 它需要耐心来管理。
　　D) It can be a good thing. D) 它可能是件好事。
　　【听音指导】本题是细节加评论题，关键要弄清楚各选项中it所指代的内容。本文出现频率最多的词是stress，可大胆推测，此题考查的是对stress的评述。本题又是此长对话的最后一题，答案应在听力对话的后两句。
　　【正确项分析】I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. 只要抓住此句中的一个关键词uncertainty，此题便可轻易而解，选项A正确。
　　【原文及译文】
　　W: So, why exactly does your job have a reputation for being stressful?
　　M: Stress is generally driven by the feeling of being out of control of a situation and the feeling of a situation controlling you. Trading in financial markets combines both.
　　W: How do you relax in the evening?
　　M: I very rarely do anything work-related so it’s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I’ve had a bad day. I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away. To do something my brain would regard as creative.
　　W: Do you think what you do for relaxation is an effective way to beat stress?
　　M: I don’t think there is a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find out what I do is effective for me.
　　W: Would you consider changing your job because of the high stress factor?
　　M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing, and if used the right way, it can actually be a positive thing.
　　W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?
　　M: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy a mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short, medium and long term trading performance and success.
　　23: What is the man’s job?
　　24: Why does the man prefer to cook a meal rather than have a take-away?
　　25: What does the man say about an element of stress in his job?
　　女士：那么，到底为什么你的工作以紧张出名呢?
　　男士：当人们束手无策或感觉被控制时，就会有压力感。金融市场上的交易正是这两者的结合。
　　女士：你晚上如何放松?
　　男士：我很少做与工作有关的事情，所以很容易逃脱市场。我通常去健身房或是出去跑步。尤其是在我感觉某天很糟糕的时候，更是如此。我总是做饭，而不是叫外卖。做点儿有创意的事。
　　女士：你认为你放松自己的方法对消除压力有效吗?
　　男士：消除压力没有特定的法宝。总的来说，我发现我所做的一切对我来说都是有效的。
　　女士：你是否因压力大而考虑换工作呢?
　　男士：因为压力的因素我曾考虑过离开我的工作。但是，我认为压力是一件好事。如果运用得当，压力实际上是有益的。
　　女士：你喜欢工作中的哪些压力?
　　男士：说了这么多，我的确喜欢不确定因素。我喜欢挑战。交易会在瞬间产生一系列大范围的情绪波动。你如何处理及管理这些情绪支配着中短期及长期交易业绩和成功。
　　23：男士的工作是什么?
　　24：为什么男士喜欢做饭，而不是叫外卖?
　　25：关于工作中的压力感，男士说了什么?

Section B
　　Passage One
　　篇章结构
　　本次四级听力篇章从内容难度上来讲，比2009年6月的更难。此篇文章属于天文类，讲的是除地球以外的星球上形成生命的可能性。曾经科学家们认为其他星球上存在生命的可能性不大，但是现在科学家在渐渐地定位那些有可能会形成生命的地方。文章对此举了一个例子，就是木星的一个卫星，叫木卫二。
　　词汇点拨
　　fascinated a. 着迷的;surface n. 表面;bacteria n 细菌;automatically ad. 自动地;probe n.探头，探针;evolution n. 进化
　　话题词汇
　　beneath prep. 在……之下  Jupiter n. 木星  　moon n. 卫星，月球  nitrogen n. 氮
　　planet n. 行星，星球   　volcanic activity 火山活动
　　难句解析
　　1. Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea of life existing somewhere else besides earth.
　　【解析】since early times作时间状语，主句主语为people，谓语为be fascinated with，即“对……着迷”，着迷的对象是idea of life，existing somewhere else besides earth为现在分词作定语修饰名词life。
　　2. The probes have also made scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat.
　　【解析】本句主句部分谓语成分为make sb. do sth.，让某人做某事，that引出think的从句。从句的主语为Europa，giving off volcanic heat作定语修饰has的宾语a rocky core。
　　试题详解
　　26. A) There were no planets without moons. A) 除了卫星外没有行星。
　　B) There was no air or water on Jupiter. B) 在木星上没有空气或水。
　　C) Life was not possible in outer space. C) 在外空是没有生命的。
　　D)The mystery of life could not be resolved D) 生命的奥秘是不能解决的。
　　【听音指导】预览选项，可知本题考查细节事实题。鉴于此题位于本短文的第一题，答案应在最初几句中找到，具体的说，是在开头30秒。选项D与其他三项明显不同，可初步排除。听音时关注no planets，no air or water还是no life。
　　【正确项分析】第一题问的是科学家曾经(once)相信什么事实?那么根据我们的理解，应该是他们认为外太空不可能存在生命。这个答案出现在原文的第二句，原文是Until recently, scientists believed that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream，意为科学家们认为在其他星球上存在生命只不过是个充满希望的梦。故选择C项。
　　27. A) It has a number of active volcanoes. A) 有很多活火山。
　　B) It has an atmosphere like the earth’s. B) 有像地球上的大气层。
　　C) It has a large ocean under its surface. C) 在它的表面有一个大海洋。
　　D) It has deep caves several miles long. D) 有几英里长的深洞穴。
　　【听音指导】通过选项即可确定本题为对于某一事物的细节描述题，所以首先要解决各选项中it所指的内容。由第一题选项可初步推测，本题很可能考查的是对一个星球的描述。
　　【正确项分析】问题为科学家在木卫二星球上找到什么，那么应该是Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface，意为航空观测镜发现了星球表面下有个大的海洋。C选项与原文一模一样。
　　28. A) Light is not an essential element to it. A) 光不是必备因素。
　　B) Life can form in very hot temperatures. B) 生命在很热的温度下能够形成。
　　C) Every form of life undergoes evolution. C) 每种生命的形成都需要进化。
　　D) Oxygen is not needed for some life forms. D) 氧在生命形成过程中没有必要。
　　【听音指导】根据惯例，最后一个问题答案出现在篇章结束前三十秒左右，选项均涉及生命形成因素，分别为light，hot temperatures，evolution和oxygen，根据这些信息，可轻易在短文结束前找到答案。
　　【正确项分析】注意转折连词but前后，原文为Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the ocean. And bacteria, primitive forms of life, have been seen there。意为科学家一直以为光是很重要的，但是现在他们发现完全黑暗的地方—比如几英里深的洞里，也有生命，即细菌。可见，光不是必备因素，选项A正确。
　　原文及译文
　　Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea of life existing somewhere else besides earth. Until recently, scientists believed that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream. But now they are beginning to locate places where life could form. In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun. But scientists now think that life could be even nearer in our own solar system. One planet scientists are studying very closely is Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface. The probes have also made the scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat. Water and heat from volcanic activity are two basic conditions needed for life to form. A third is certain basic chemicals such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Scientists believe there might be such chemicals lying at the bottom of Europa’s ocean. They may have already created life or may be about to. You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form. Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the ocean. And bacteria, primitive forms of life have been seen there. So the lack of light in Europa’s sub-surface ocean doesn’t automatically rule out life forming.
　　26. What did scientists once believe according to the passage?
　　27. What have scientists found about Europa, a moon of Jupiter?
　　28. What have scientists come to know recently about the formation of life?
　　从很早以前，人们一直迷恋着地球以外的地方也存在生命的想法。直到近来，科学家们认为在其他星球上存在生命只不过是个充满希望的梦。但是，现在他们开始查找可能有生命的地方。1997年，科学家们在恒星附近，例如太阳，发现了行星的踪迹。科学家们现在认为生命可能我们更近，就在太阳系内。科学家们正密切关注的地方是木卫二，木星的一个卫星。太空探测器提供了证据表明木卫二表层之下有一个海洋。探测器也让科学家们认为木卫二表层有散发出火山热的岩石核心。火山活动的水和热量是生命形成的两个基本条件。第三个是一些基本的化学物质，如碳、氧和氮。科学家们认为在木卫二海洋底部可能存在这样的化学成分。他们可能已经创造了生命或即将产生生命。你可能在想光也是生命形成的必要条件。直到最近，科学家们仍认为光是不可或缺的。但现在已经在地球上发现，海洋几英里之下的黑暗的洞穴内有细菌，即原始生命形式的存在。所以不能排除缺乏光的木卫二地下海洋有生命形成的可能性。
　　26. 根据短文，科学家曾相信什么?
　　27. 科学家们发现关于木卫二的什么信息?
　　28. 最近，科学家就生命的形成了解到什么?
　　Passage Two
　　篇章结构
　　本篇讲述医生发现用纸记录下的东西比口语交流的信息更加准确和稳定。问题源自一位医生在对一个孩子的家庭口述交待了出院后的注意事项之后，发现这些亲属们竟然记不清到底医生讲了些什么，于是医生决定在以后交待注意事项的时候要把这些内容全印成纸质的东西，因为纸质的东西比口语更可靠。

　　难句解析
　　1. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members.
　　【解析】此句为倒装句，强调listening to her，主语为a half a dozen other family members。正常语序为：A half a dozen other family members were also listening to her.
　　2. All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions.
　　【解析】本句两分句由连词but连接，had heard为过去完成时，表示在家人问玛雅医生之前就发生了此动作。I have given just a few hours before做定语修饰the simple instructions，省略连接词that。 
试题详解
　　29. A) Whether they should take the child home. A) 他们是否应该将孩子带回家。
　　B) What Dr. Mayer’s instructions exactly were. B) 玛雅医生的医嘱到底是什么。
　　C) Who should take care of the child at home. C) 谁在家照顾孩子。
　　D) When the child would completely recover. D) 什么时候这个孩子能完全恢复。
　　【听音指导】浏览四个选项，应注意到都为wh-开头的疑问词，且提到了医生和孩子，take care of 以及recover，可初步推测此题涉及的场景为医院，病人为孩子。
　　【正确项分析】问题为孩子的家人因为什么而争论，原文为the family asked her to settle an argument they’d been having over exactly what advice she had given，意为亲属们就医生到底讲过什么建议争论不休，问医生如何解决。选项B中的instructions与原文的advice同义，选项B正确。
　　30. A) She encourages them to ask questions when in doubt. A) 她鼓励他们拿不准时就提问题。
　　B) She makes them write down all her instructions. B) 她让他们记下她的医嘱。
　　C) She has them act out what they are to do at home. C) 她让他们把将在家里做的事情表演出来。
　　D) She asks them to repeat what are supposed to do. D) 她让他们复述要做的事。
　　【听音指导】由第一题的选项可很有把握地推测she指代的是Doctor Myer，而与医生相对的多半为病人。注意关键词ask question，write down，act out和repeat。
　　【正确项分析】玛雅医生如何确定病人完全明白了自己的建议呢?原文为She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do，原文的 tell her与选项D中的关键词repeat一致，选项D为正确答案，
　　31. A) It lacks the stability of the printed word. A) 它缺乏印刷体的稳定性。
　　B) It contains many grammatical errors. B) 它包含许多语法错误。
　　C) It is heavily dependent on the context. C) 它十分依赖上下文语境。
　　D) It facilitates interpersonal communication. D) 它有助于人际交往。
　　【听音指导】本题为短文最后一题，应在文章最后出现。需要注意关键字stability，errors，context和communication。
　　【正确项分析】此题是典型的篇章问题考法。答案出现在结尾处，问题是作者对于人类口语交流 (human speech) 总结了什么。原文为human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word，与选项A一致。
　　原文及译文
　　In her early days as an emergency room physician, Doctor Joanna Mayer treated a child who had suffered a second degree burn. After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Doctor Mayer talked to the parents about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they’d been having over exactly what advice she had given. “As I talked to them, I was amazed.” she said, “All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.” This episode gave Doctor Mayer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later---- most people just don’t listen very well.
　　Nowadays, she says she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts tailored to the patients’ situation. Doc. Mayer’s listeners are not unusual. When new or difficult material is presented, almost all listeners are faced with a challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word. Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.
　　29. What did the child’s family members argue about in the hospital?
　　30. What does Doc. Mayer do to insure her patients understand her instructions?
　　31. What does the speaker say about human speech?
　　乔安娜?玛雅是一名急诊室医生。早年，她曾医治了一名二度烧伤的孩子。这个孩子接受完治疗准备出院时，玛雅医生告诉孩子父母在家如何照顾孩子，在场的还有六位家庭其他成员。几小时后，当她来与孩子再见的时候，孩子一家请她解决争论，他们一直争论她的医嘱到底是什么。“因为我已经告诉过他们，所以我很惊讶。”她说，“他们所有的人都在短短几小时前听到了我给出的简单的医嘱，但是他们有三、四个不同的版本。最基本的细节都不清楚且很困惑。我很吃惊，因为这些是聪明人。”这一段插曲给了玛雅医生第一个线索，而这迟早每个医生都会懂得，即大多数人听的不准确。
　　如今，玛雅说她反复重复医嘱，甚至对一些病人进行现场核查。她要他们告诉她他们应该做的事。她还根据病人的情况提供可带回家的打印文本。玛雅医生的听众都是正常人。当面对新资料或难度较大的资料时，几乎所有的听众都会面临挑战，因为人类口语缺乏书面文字的稳定性和永久性。口头交流速度快但持续时间短。
　　29. 孩子的家庭成员在医院里争论的是什么?
　　30. 为确保病人明白她的医嘱，玛雅医生做了什么?
　　31. 说话者如何评述人类口语?
　　Passage Three
　　篇章结构
　　此篇讲的是商务工作中对员工的激励机制。主要内容为公司对员工的激励机制并非是人们通常以为的工资或者工作环境，而是工作中的挑战。
　　词汇点拨
　　challenging a. 挑战性的;logical a. 合理的;manually ad. 手动地;identify v. 认同;tedious a. 单调的，沉闷的
　　话题词汇
　　arbitrarily ad. 专横地  mechanical a. 机械的  robotics n. 机器人学  　by definition 当然
　　job security 职业安全感  　labor relations 劳资关系
　　难句解析
　　1. It’s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers.
　　【解析】此句结构是由转折连词but引导的两个分句。前面一个分句中，it做形式主语，后面的不定式to suppose是真正主语。That引导宾语从句，介词like以及其引导内容做things的后置定语。后面一个分句中，one expert 与Frederick Herzberg为同位语，that后引导宾语从句。
　　2. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them.
　　【解析】本句主句为there be 句型，常见的短语with the development of作时间状语，意为“随着……的发展”。jobs和people为表语，三个并列形容词boring， repetitive 和 mechanical一起修饰jobs，who引导的定语从句修饰先行词unskilled people
试题详解
　　32. A) Job security. A) 职业安全感。
　　B) Good labor relations. B) 愉快的劳资关系。
　　C) Challenging work. C) 挑战性的工作。
　　D) Attractive wages and benefits. D) 有吸引力的工资和利益。
　　【听音指导】预览选项中的关键词job security，labor relation，work，和wages and benefits可知，此篇短文主旨与工作有关，可初步推测与人们对工作的满足感有关。
　　【正确项分析】此题问的是主题，到底什么可以真正激励员工好好工作呢。原文Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and interesting job, recognition and responsibility，连接词in contrast附近出现了答案，意为起到激励作用的东西包括工作的挑战性和趣味性，以及工作中需承担的责任即最终获得的认可。所以选选项C，即挑战性的工作。
　　【干扰项分析】原文首句虽谈及选项A、B、D各项内容，但是but转折后全盘否定but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers。故可全部排除。
　　33. A) Many tedious jobs continue to be done manually. A) 许多单调工作继续由手工做。
　　B) More and more unskilled workers will lose jobs. B) 越来越多的非技术工人将失业。
　　C) Computers will change the nature of many jobs. C) 电脑将改变很多工作性质。
　　D) Boring jobs will gradually be made enjoyable. D) 无聊的工作将变得快乐。
　　【听音指导】从选项内容可知，本题考查的是工作的性质，应注意关键提示词—tedious，unskilled and lose job，computer和boring and enjoyable。
　　【正确项分析】此题问到作者对电脑信息时代总结了什么。从原文中However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them.，连接词however后出现了答案。意为，尽管电脑和机器人技术不断发展，还是存在无聊的、重复的、机械性的工作，需要人力完成，对应到正确答案A选项中的tedious以及manually。

　　C) They are arbitrarily set by the administrators. C) 是管理人员随意制定的。
　　D) They are beyond the control of ordinary workers. D) 他们超出了普通工人的控制。
　　【听音指导】首先意识到最后一题的答案应在文章结束前几句找，由各选项可知，所描述的对象并不是积极的，而是有负面影响的。
　　【正确项分析】为什么金钱诱惑刺激不了工作热情，答案出现在结尾前30秒处，即Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which automatically only concern a few people，意为团队精神更能激起工作热情，因为金钱利益最终只会与团队中的个别人相关。答案为选项B。
　　原文及译文
　　It’s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers. They are merely satisfiers. Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and interesting job, recognition and responsibility. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them. So how do managers motivate people in such jobs? One solution is to give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as a team. For example, some supermarkets combine office staff, the people who fill the shelves, and the people who work at the checkout into a team, and let them decide what product lines to stock, how to display them and so on. Many people now talk about the importance of a company’s shared values or culture with which all the staff can identify, for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best, the most user-friendly or the most reliable products in a particular field. Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which ultimately only concern a few people. Unfortunately, there’s only a limited number of such goals to go around and by definition, not all the competing companies in an industry can seriously play in to be the best.
　　32: What can actually motivate workers according to Frederick Herzberg?
　　33: What does the speaker say about jobs in the computer era?
　　34: What do some supermarkets do to motivate employees?
　　35: Why does the speaker say financial targets are less likely to motivate workers?
　　认为良好的劳资关系、愉悦的工作环境、较高的工资和福利待遇、工作安全性好能够激励员工，这是完全符合逻辑的。然而，专家弗洛迪克?赫兹伯格认为这些条件并不能激励员工，只是让员工得到满足的物质条件而已。相反，激励因素包括挑战性和趣味性的工作、认可和责任等。然而，即使随着计算机技术和机器人技术的发展，仍有大量无聊的、重复的和机械的工作，并且还必须有大量做这些工作的非技术人员。所以管理人员如何激励从事这种工作的人呢? 一种解决办法就是让他们承担责任，不是作为个人，而是作为团队。例如，有些超市把办公室人员、填货人和收银员编成一组，让他们决定进什么货、产品如何陈列等。现在很多人在谈论员工认同的公司的价值观和公司文化的重要性，如怎样成为最好的旅馆连锁，或在某一特定领域做最好的，用户最亲善的或者最可靠的产品。这样的价值观比那些只与少数人有关的财务目标更有可能激励员工。不幸的是，只有个别公司才会有这样的目标，当然，并不是所有的竞争公司在业界都能做成最好的。
　　32：根据弗洛迪克?赫兹伯格的观点，什么可以激励员工?
　　33：说话者就计算机时代的工作发表了什么观点?
　　34：一些超市为激励员工采取了什么措施?
　　35：为什么说财务目标不太可能激发员工?

　　原文重现
　　In the humanities, authors write to inform you in many ways. These methods can be (36) classified into three types of informational writing: factual, descriptive, and process. Factual writing provides (37) background information on an author, composer or artist or on a type of music, literature, or art. Examples of factual writing include notes on a book jacket or (38) album cover and longer pieces, such as an article describing a style of music which you might read in a music (39) appreciation course. This kind of writing provides a (40) context for your study of the humanities.
　　As its name (41) implies, descriptive writing simply describes or provides an (42) image of, a piece of music, art or literature. For example, descriptive writing might list the colors an artist used in a painting or the (43) instruments a composer included in a musical composition, so as to make pictures of sounds in the readers’ mind by calling up specific details of the work. (44) Descriptive writing in humanity, particularly in literature is often mixed with critical writing.
　　Process writing explains a series of actions that bring about a result. (45) It tells the reader how to do something, for example, explaining the technique used to show a film. This kind of writing is often found in art, where understanding how an art has created a certain effect is important. (46)Authors may actually use more than one type of techniques in the given piece of informational writing.

　　试题详解
　　36.【听音指导】根据空前后内容，可推测此空意为“归类成……”，轻易可以联想到常考词classified，构成be classified into结构。
　　37.【听音指导】事实性写作方式会提供什么样的信息，在预读时，很容易将其推测为形容词，但background是常见词，而background information作为背景知识，在日常生活中常常用到。
　　38.【听音指导】此空中的内容与book，long piece并列，可知此空填写的词为名词，且与book等为一类。album发音特殊，一般不会与其他词相混，应注意拼写。
　　39.【听音指导】由题意很容易判断此部分应为音乐鉴赏课，此空的难点在于appreciation (“鉴赏”)这个词的拼写。appreciate作动词，意为鉴赏，此空需要其名词形式。
　　40.【听音指导】为研究人文学科提供环境，其中context是高频词，几乎在每次考试中都能考到，此题不易失分。
　　41.【听音指导】此句话应理解为“正如名字所显示的那样”，立刻可以联系到show等词，而原文中的imply在以往四级考试中也反复出现。
　　42.【听音指导】描述性的写作能提供什么?立刻就想到形象、印象。image这个词很容易填出。
　　43.【听音指导】作曲家所用的音乐器具，自然为musical instrument。然而此空需要注意的是它的复数形式。
　　44.【听音指导】此段讲述的是descriptive writing，此句位于本段的最后一句，应为总结性话语。答案为Descriptive writing in the humanities, particularly in literature is often mixed with critical writing。particularly可替换为especially，be mixed with意为“与……混合”。也可写为Descriptive writing is mixed with critical writing，那么既保留了句子的大意，而且也能规避如particularly这样的长难词。采分点为descriptive writing和critical writing。
　　45.【听音指导】此段讲述的是processing writing，按照惯例此句为对其的总结性解释。shoot a film，意为拍电影。采分点为how to do something和 technique。
　　46.【听音指导】整篇文章为总分式，先总述了三种写作题材，然后分别讲述每种写作题材的适用范围。此空独立成句，很可能论述三部分适用范围的交集。采分点为more than one type of technique is used in writing。
　　全文精译
　　在人文学科中，作者可以通过多种写作方式告知读者信息。这些方法可分为三类信息写作题材：事实性的，描述性的和解说性的。事实性写作提供了一位作家、作曲家或艺术家或者是一种音乐、文学或艺术的背景信息。事实性写作包括封面上的说明和专辑封面，较长的作品如音乐鉴赏课中可能读到的描述一种音乐风格的文章。这种写作题材为人文学科研究提供了依据。
　　正如它的名字所暗示的，描写性写作指简单的描述或为一段音乐、一种艺术和文学树立一种形象。例如，描写性写作可能介绍一位艺术家在画中用过的色彩，或一位乐器作曲家在音乐作品中所用的乐器。通过具体描述，在读者的脑海里留下声音的图画。人文学科中的描写性写作，特别在文学中，经常与评论式写作共同使用。
　　解说性写作是解释会带来某种结果的一系列的行动。它告诉读者如何做某事，例如，拍电影的技术。这种写作往往用于艺术中，因为理解艺术家如何创造了一种特定效果是很重要的。在一篇指定的信息写作中，作者可以运用多种写作技巧。

　　全文精译
　　2009年毕业的高中生进入牛津大学的同时，他们也会迎来一个新的面孔，安德鲁 ?汉密尔顿，55岁的耶鲁大学教务长。他将入主牛津，职位相当于美国大学的校长。
　　汉密尔顿并不是第一位跨越大西洋到外国任职的教育家。法国、埃及、新家坡等一些国家的学校近年来纷纷从国外聘请学校的高层管理人员。像其他商业活动一样，如今，高等教育已成为极具竞争力的商业行为，并且日渐国际化。但是人才的流动并不是世界性的。高层的管理人员往往来自一个地方：美国。
　　其主要原因是许多学校并不真地想从国外引进人才。例如，科罗拉多大学董事会在遴选新校长时，想聘用一个与州政府熟悉的领导人，因为州政府是学校的主要资金来源。“我们不会在全球范围内聘用校长”，帕特立夏?海说，该校最终聘用了布鲁斯?本森，69岁的科罗拉多州商人、政治活动家。他能够胜任现代大学校长的职务：筹措资金。筹措资金为美国大学所特有，因为美国大学的运转主要依赖捐款。筹措资金的能力在很大程度上依靠经验，也是美国校长必须具备的能力。
　　与此同时，很多欧洲大学仍然依靠政府投入。而政府的投入却没能跟上不断扩大的学生规模。政府投入的减少，使得筹措资金成为学校管理部门的当务之急，于是对美国的人才求贤若渴。
　　在过去几年里，世界各地的优秀学校都加入了这一行列。2003年，剑桥大学任命前耶鲁大学教务长艾莉森?理查德为副校长。学校公开强调艾莉森之前的工作确保了“耶鲁大学财政状况良好”。
　　当然，这些外国管理者不仅只是筹措资金。教育全球化意味着更多的大学将要聘用那些具有国际经验的校长，以促进国际间项目的合作，招收留学生。外国人能够给学校业已成立的体系带来新的活力。

　　【译文】现在的教育方法倾向于年轻人和技能性训练，难以应对人口结构变化的挑战。
　　5. The challenges include the fact that most people can expect to spend a third of their lives in retirement, that there are now more people over 59 than under 16 and that 11.3 million people are over state pension age.

　　【译文】人们需要一个“中年回首”的机会来适应以后的工作生涯，规划退休后的角色转化。这种转化可以发生在五十岁到九十多岁的漫长时间内。
　　试题详解
　　67. 【快速解题】本题考查动词词义辨析。
　　B【正确项分析】这四个动词都能够与介词on搭配，因此此处应在首段基础上着手分析该句句意。首段提出老年人学习的重要性，而该句“年轻人和技能性训练”指出了该项方法的侧重点。focus on“集中，针对”，因此确定答案为选项B。
　　【干扰项分析】根据句意可以比较容易地排除其他三此个干扰项，depend on依靠，依赖;count on依靠，指望;operate on对……实施手术。
　　68. 【快速解题】本题考查形容词词义辨析。
　　D【正确项分析】该空格所要填的词应该与前文内容相呼应，首段指出老年人需要学习，而本句侧重的是年轻人的职业技能。这说明该教育方法面临挑战，由此可见它是不充分的，因此确定答案为选项D。
　　【干扰项分析】superior高级的，出众的;essential基本的;regular有规则的，有秩序的。均不符合该句上下文的关系，故排除。
　　【篇章分析】该句句意为“现在的教育方法倾向于年轻人和技能性训练，难以应对人口结构变化的挑战。”older people，younger people和demographic change之间的关系能够帮助考生迅速确定答案。另外从后句的表达也可以帮助找出该题的正确答案。
　　69. 【快速解题】本题为副词词义辨析题。
　　A【正确项分析】only 1%指出当前对老年人投入的教育资金之有限，符合题意的选项应为currently“通常，当前”。因此正确选项为选项A。

　　70. 【快速解题】本题为词义辨析题。
　　C【正确项分析】该空在本句中作主语成分，其后面的内容均涉及老龄人口和退休人员的现状，结合前文教育状况，可以判断challenge“挑战”最符合该句句意。因此选C选项。
　　【干扰项分析】regulation规则，规章;obstacle障碍;guideline方针;用在本句均显勉强。
　　【篇章分析】虽然本题属于词义辨析题，但根据前后文信息复现能够迅速确定答案。如果考生细心的话，就会发现第二段曾经指出对“人口结构的挑战”，此处列举挑战的种种问题。
　　71. 【快速解题】本题为词义辨析题。
　　B【正确项分析】解答本题除了能够辨析四个名词词义外，还要从句意入手推敲最符合题意的答案。该句说的是老龄人口的问题，同时指出他们退休后时间漫长，暗示对他们进行教育投入的必要性。所以正确答案为选项B。
　　【干扰项分析】enjoyment享受，享乐;stability稳定性;inability无能，无力;均不符合题意，故排除。
　　【篇章分析】本题并非单纯的词义辨析，应该在篇章的基础上把握上下文暗示的信息。
　　72. 【快速解题】本题是介词词义辨析题。
　　A【正确项分析】从state pension age“领退休金的年龄”，和前文指出的老龄人口之众，可以判断over state pension age “达到国家法定领取退休金年龄”。故正确选项为选项A。
　　【能力拓展】age不仅仅指年龄，还有很多其他搭配，表示“时期“，如the Stone Age石器时代;the computer age电脑时代。
　　73. 【快速解题】本题为词义辨析题。
　　B【正确项分析】前文一直在说老年人教育问题，同时强调对这些人进行教育投入的必要性。该句作为第四段主题句，承接上文指出“学习应贯穿人的一生“。所以正确选项为B。
　　【干扰项分析】practice练习，训练;instruct教导，命令;identify识别，鉴别。均可根据上下文排除。
　　74. 【快速解题】本题考查固定搭配。
　　D【正确项分析】该句主语为concentration“集中，专注”，其后常跟介词on，构成concentration on“集中于……”。因此答案为选项D。
　　【能力拓展】英语中蕴含着丰富的词语搭配，考生在备考过程中有意识地对这些固定搭配进行识记，考试时便可从容应对。例如：live on/by靠……生活，以……为食; lie in在于;appeal to呼吁，要求;aim at瞄准，针对。
　　75. 【快速解题】本题考查固定搭配。
　　C【正确项分析】该句要求考生选择动词meet的固定搭配，从其句意可以判断出是“满足要求”之意，meet the needs/requirements是常用的表达。因此正确选项为选项C。
　　【干扰项分析】realm领域;intention意图，目的;desire期望，欲望。均可排除。
　　【能力拓展】英语中有些动词常跟固定搭配的名词构成词组，如pay attention to注意;bring access to接近;lay emphasis on强调。考生应在备考中注意积累。

77. 【快速解题】本题考查上下文逻辑关系。
　　A【正确项分析】该句为主从复合句，主句“处在各种年龄段的人们都渴望重新学习的机会”，从句作为一个时间状语指出当前的背景：人们工作和居住地不断变化，生活伴侣和生活方式也不断更新。因此应该选择选项A。
　　【干扰项分析】whether引导让步状语从句，可迅速排除;until和before虽引导时间状语从句，但其表达的时间概念不符合本句句意。
　　【篇章分析】该题所要填的是一个表示时间关系的连词，所以要从句意上着手分析。
　　78. 【快速解题】本题考查词义辨析。
　　C【正确项分析】通过对本句句式结构的分析可以看出，该空缺处应添一个与jobs，partners和lifestyles相并列的词汇，所以正确选项为选项C。
　　【干扰项分析】mind思想;mood心情;neighbour邻居。比较起来，home更加贴近文中的事实，“人们工作和居住地不断变化”。
　　79. 【快速解题】本题考查固定搭配。
　　B【正确项分析】四个选项都有“之前”的意思，所以很难通过词义辨析选出正确答案。但与比较词than搭配时，应固定地使用ever，表示“比以前任何时候都……”，因此正确选项为选项B。
　　【干扰项分析】formerly“从前，以前”，一般常用former，较少使用formerly;previously“先前，以前”;ago常与某一过去时间段搭配。
　　80. 【快速解题】本题考查上下文逻辑关系。

　　【干扰项分析】transform 转换;suit 适应;yield 屈服。均不符合题意。
　　82. 【快速解题】本题考查固定搭配。
　　D【正确项分析】该题非常简单，属于对常见短语搭配的考查。与transition搭配的介词为to，表示“向……过渡“。所以正确选项为选项D。

　　全文精译
　　今天发表的一项新的人口研究报告表明：老年人要想不成为社会的负担，继续发挥余热，就必须有更多学习机会。
　　该报告声称：现在的教育方法倾向于年轻人和技能性训练，难以应对人口结构变化的挑战。占人口总数三分之一的老年人只占有百分之一的教育预算。
　　这些挑战包括：多数人三分之一的生命将在退休后度过;五十九岁以上人数高于十六岁以下人数;一千一百三十万人达到了国家法定领取退休金年龄。
　　报告的作者史蒂芬?迈克威尔教授说：“学习应该贯穿人生的整个过程，我们以前的政策重心和资源配置更多偏重于年轻人，难以适应新的需求。
　　绝大多数教育预算集中在二十五岁以下的年轻人身上。当今社会，由于人们工作和居住地不断变化，生活伴侣和生活方式也不断更新，处在各种年龄段的人们都渴望重新学习的机会。”例如，该报告指出有些人到了五十多岁又重新开始创业。
　　人们需要一个“中年回首”的机会来适应以后的工作生涯，规划退休后的角色转化。这种转化可以发生在五十岁到九十多岁的漫长时间内。应该有更多的资金来保证人们塑造个性和在“第三年龄段”发挥建设性作用。
　　　87. had followed my instructions/orders
　　【结构分析】本句的主语是You。谓语动词是would not have failed。if you had followed my instructions是if引导的条件状语从句。
　　【要点解析】本题考查的是虚拟语气的用法。①if从句的虚拟语气考查，根据语法规定，如果主句中出现would +have的形式，从句中应该采用had+过去分词的结构。②“按照……的指令”可表达为follow my instructions/orders。③ 根据主句的would not have failed 结构就可以推断这是对过去事实的虚拟，那么从句则是had+done 结构，所以答案为you had followed my instructions/orders。
　　【原句精译】如果你按照我的指令去做，就不会失败了。
　　88. gave up pursuing knowledge
　　【结构分析】 本句的主语是Mark。谓语是gave up pursuing knowledge。despite the hardship he encountered是despite引导的状语从句。
　　【要点解析】本题考查动词give的搭配。①“放弃”可译为give up。 ②encounter the hardship也是非常重要的固定搭配，意为“遇到困难”。需要填写的部分应该采用过去时。③“对知识的追求”可译为pursuing knowledge.
　　【原句精译】尽管马克遇到困难，但是他从未放弃对知识的追求。
　　【能力拓展】动词give的常见搭配。①give up放弃，交出 例：When you graduate, will you give up your study? 你毕业后会不会放弃学习? ②give oneself up to献身于，沉溺于，热衷于 例：The boy gives himself up to electronic games. 这个男孩沉溺于电子游戏。③give away泄露，出卖 例：He gave my secret away. 他泄露了我的秘密。④give in屈服，让步 例：You must give in your examination papers now. 你们现在必须把试卷交上来。
　　89. before we find the methods of curing cancers/ before we find the cure for cancer
　　【结构分析】本句的主语是Scientists，谓语是agree，that it will be a long time是that引导的宾语从句，before we find the methods of curing cancers是before引导的时间状语从句。
　　【要点解析】“治愈”可译为cure，而不应译为treat，treat是“治疗”的意思。cure有疗法的意思，所以治愈癌症的方法还可以译为cure for cancer。根据句子的已知部分，可以判断出填写的部分用一般现在时
　　【原句精译】科学家们认为，要过很长时间才能找到治愈癌症的方法。
　　【能力拓展】before引导的状语从句。①句型A：it+be+一段时间+before…：意思是“要过很久才会……”。例：The field research will take John and Mike about five months; it will be a long time before we meet them again. 实地考察要花约翰和迈克五个月的时间;他们过很久才会再见面。②句型B：it was some time before…：意思是“在……之前过了一段时间”。例：He was told that it would be at least three more months before he could recover and return to work. 他被告知至少过三个月才能康复，重返工作岗位。
　　90. keep pace with the constantly increasing demands of consumers或keep up with the constantly growing needs of consumers
　　【结构分析】本句的主语是Production，谓语是has to be increased，后面的to keep pace with the constantly increasing demands of consumers是目的状语。
　　【要点解析】 ① 固定搭配“与……保持同步”，可以翻译为keep pace with 或keep up with。②“不断增长的”，可以翻译为increasing，growing或rising。③“需求”可翻译为demands或needs。④“消费者”翻译为consumer。
　　【原句精译】只有大幅提高产量才能与消费者不断增长的需求保持同步。
　　【能力拓展】①keep pace with和……并驾齐驱，跟上 例：We must work hard to keep pace with the development of modern technology. 我们必须努力学习才能跟上现代科技的发展。②keep up with赶得上，和……保持联系 例：Students must work hard to keep up with their school work. 学生必须努力学习才能跟上功课。
　　91. the fewer chances you will have of catching a cold
　　【结构分析】本句的前半部分是从句，后半部分是主句。主句的主语是You。谓语是will have。【要点解析】本题主要考查 the more，the less的用法。其用法与the more，the more一致，可翻译为“越……越……”。①固定搭配“可能做某事”，可翻译为be likely to do sth;②固定搭配“感冒”，可翻译为catch a cold。
　　【原句精译】锻炼越多，你越不大可能感冒。
　　【能力拓展】“越……越……”句型：这种句型表达为：the+比较级+句子，the+比较级+句子。若the more修饰名词，则名词要提前，直接置于the more后，如试题中句子：The more exercise you take, the fewer chances you will have of catching a cold

2009年6月英语四级考试答案解析
Part I 	Writing 
Free Admission to Museums
	In recently years it has become increasingly popular for more and more museums to offer free admission to visitors, be them children or adults, citizens or tourists. The purposes for this, as I see them, are quite straightforward. First, free admission to museums is a feasible and effective way to enhance the public’s awareness of our cultural and historical heritage. Second, free access to museums provides a good educational opportunity; as visitors look at those invaluable treasures, they will feel the urge to learn. Besides, free admission to museums also promotes and popularizes Chinese culture both home and abroad. 
	However, free admission to museums may also cause some problems. There may be huge crowds of visitors on holidays or for some exhibitions, which may cause disturbance or chaos; the presence of large crowds may also cause damage to the things on display, for example, some visitors often use flash lights where they are not supposed to. What’s more, free admission and the crowds that follow is a test to the museums’ finance, maintenance, and management abilities. 
	This being said, I still believe free admission to museums is a plausible idea; only certain measures need to be taken to ensure that museums get enough funds to maintain and manage their exhibitions, and that the flow of visitors is controlled and their behaviors regulated. This way free admission to museums can be a lasting and beneficial practice. 

Part II	Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)
原文分析：
　　本文是一篇说明文，讲述人们对文化diversity（多元性）应该有兼容并包的态度。本文结构非常清晰，开篇用Tiffany面试错过最佳候选人的例子来引出人们因为对不同文化的误解(misunderstanding)或假设(assumption)而经常犯错误；文中的每个小标题都是一种错误，并都用diversity workshop参与者的切身经历来例证。结尾部分，作者提出人们都应该正视自己思想模式的缺陷，用开放的态度对待文化多元性。
　　快速阅读不要求仔细通读全文，只要对文章的结构有大概了解，通过浏览定位关键词找答案。本文段落繁多，但结构清晰，小标题清楚指出每一部分的主题，而且题目的定位词非常明确，只需根据题目在原文对应段落中找到定位词即可。需要注意的是考题都是按顺序出现的，这就可以缩小定位范围，同时也意味着最后三个填空题都出现在文章的最后部分。
1. A   本题定位词为“Tiffany，interview，bother”。答案在第一段，but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said “untrustworthy”。所以选A。第一段中两次强调了这一事实，she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact.
2. C   本题紧随上一题，问的是Tiffany对自己错误的反思，答案也紧随第一题答案在第二段，即What she hadn’t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate’s “different” behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding. 所以选C。
3. B   本题定位词“essential, economic globalization”, 在原文开头部分的结尾，即it is becoming essential to expand our understanding of others and to re-examine some of our false assumptions，B选项与黑体部分同义。
4. B   本题的定位词为Mindsets LLC。专有名词十分显眼，在第一个小标题下的第一段有对这家公司的描述：helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots，结合上下文给出的例子，选B。
5. D   Dale这个名字出现在小标题“Blinded by Gender”部分，其实即可以判断答案为D。原文对应的句子为：I learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases（不应该存有性别偏见） into the situation, I needed to … 
6. C   本题与上题问的都是Dale参加完workshop的收获，答案也在一起，即Dale credits（称赞）the workshop, “because it helped me make decisions based on fairness.”，选C，It helped him make fair decisions。
7. A    Doug这个名字出现在小标题“Year of Know-it-all”部分，当他的美籍华裔员工向他请假过春节时，他的第一反应是I assumed he had his dates wrong, 并且gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates。
8. embarrassed   本题答案非常明确，原文为I(Dough) felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up.
9. inclusiveness   本题稍带总结性，在 “Year of Know-it-all”以及“A Better Bottom Line”两部分，参与者都提到了inclusiveness的重要性：Doug admits. “The biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more ‘inclusive’ to differences.”，以及These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales.而在倒数第二段，作者也作了总结：Once we start to see people as individuals and discard the stereotypes, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone.
10. differences and similarities   本题题干几乎与原文完全一致，在倒数第二段， 即Once we start to see people as individuals and discard the stereotypes, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone. Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities.

Part III Listening Comprehension 
Section A
11. D  原文：W: There were more than a hundred people at Kate's birthday party. How come she's got so many friends?
      M: It's really no surprise. You know she was popular even when she was a child.
      Q: What does the man imply about Kate?
      推理题。问题问的是“imply”（暗示），即需要对原文进行推理。男士对Kate的说法是she was popular       even when she was a child（她是孩子时就很受欢迎了），那么现在有一百多人参加她的生日晚会也不足为奇，所以选D。
12. C  原文：M: They say there'll be a snow-storm tonight, and the cold weather will last quite a few days.
      W: Oh! We're so lucky, we'll be getting away for a while, and having a holiday in Florida. But let's call right now to confirm our flight.
      Q: What do we learn about the two speakers?
      语言点：Be used to doing 习惯做某事
      场景题。本文的场景是两人在讨论度假计划，原文非常明确：we'll be getting away for a while, and having a holiday in Florida.已经可以判断C，They are going to have a holiday为正确答案。A、B、D都是对对话中细节的混淆，the cold weather will last只是说有寒流到来，并非they are not used to living in a cold place（不习惯住在冷的地方）；have a holiday in Florida也不是live in Florida；至于air ticket，原文明确说的是confirm our flight（确认航班），可见已经订票。
13. B  原文：W: Tony was awarded a medal for rescuing several families from the forest fire.
      M: I really admire his courage.
      Q: What do we learn about Tony from the conversation?
      语言点：Award sb. sth. / award sth. to sb. 授予某人某物 Accuse sb. of sth. / be accused of sth. 因为某事（被）指责
主旨题。原文说Tony因为rescuing several families from the forest fire（丛森林大火中救出了好几家人）而获得奖章，所以男士说I really admire his courage（敬佩他的勇气），答案为B。D（他被指责引起了大火）明显是错误的，A（Tony很高兴获得奖章）及C（Tony曾经是救火队员）都不符合原文。
14. B  原文：M: My washing machine is more than fifteen years old and it has worked just fine until last night.
　　W: You'll never be able to get parts for it, even from Japan. So it might be time to invest a more recent model.
　　Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?
　　语言点：Part 零件  Invest 投资
建议题。原文有非常明显的建议句型：it might be time to do sth. （是该做…的时候了），女士的建议是：So it might be time to invest a more recent model. （是时候投资一台更新款式的洗衣机了），所以选B。A为干扰项，invest通常是投资的意思，但这里仅指投资买洗衣机，而非make a profitable investment（进行有利可图的投资）。
15. D  原文：W: I heard about your promotion, you must be thrilled.
　　M: Not really, the new office is huge, but the work load has doubled.
       Q: What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
　　语言点：Promotion 升职   Thrilled 兴奋的   Work load 工作负担
态度题。问题问的是男士对于升职的态度，女士说you must be thrilled（你一定很兴奋吧），男士回答not really，已经可以确定D为正确答案；他进一步给出了解释，虽然办公室很大，但是the work load has doubled（工作负担增加了一倍），但并不能从中看出he finds the work load unbearable（不可忍受的）。
16. D  原文：W: I can't decide what to do about the party tomorrow。
　　M: You don't have to go if you don't want to, but I'll be glad to give you a ride if you do。
       Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
       语言点：Give you a ride 开车带你一段
细节题。女士不知道明天的party该不该去，男士则说I'll be glad to give you a ride if you do（如果你去的话，我可以开车带你），所以选D。本题的重点是要理解what to do，这里指的是whether to go to the party。
17. C  原文：M: Now if you have any questions about the contract. I'll be happy to answer them.
W: Nothing comes to mind right now, but I'd like to go over all the articles of the contract once more before signing it.
Q: What are the speakers doing right now?
语言点：Go over 仔细检查   Articles of the contract 合同条款。注意article这里的意思是“条款”。
场景题。很明显两人在讨论contract，并且是在sign（签署）之前最后一次检查条款，所以选C。
18. A  原文：M: We are out of paper for the printer. Can you please order some?
W: I completed the order form online yesterday and it will be here by noon. I'll let you know when it comes in。
Q: What did the woman do?
语言点：Be out of sth. 用完了
细节题。问题问女士做了什么，答案为：I completed the order form online yesterday，买的是纸，所以选A。

19. Why does old Jake look terribly depressed?
20. What do we learn about Jake's wife?

W: Hello, Mr. Summerfield. How are you today?
M: Very well. Thank you, Ms. Green.
W: What can I do for you?
M: Well, unfortunately, there is a problem with the order we received from you yesterday. It seems we haven not received the right quantity of manuals to support the telephone system. (23)
W: Oh, dear, that's bad news. I'm very sorry to hear that, and you don't know how many packs are without manuals?
M: No, because we haven't opened every pack. But in several of those that have been opened there are none, no manuals. (23)
W: I'm very sorry about this inconvenience, Mr. Summerfield. We'll send out the manuals this afternoon by express mail entirely at our cost, (24) and the manuals should arrive tomorrow or the day after at the latest.
M: All of them, right?

25. What does the man think of the solution?
语言点：Manuel 说明书，手册  Inconvenience 不方便  By express mail 通过快递  At our cost (at one’s cost) 由我们付费
23．C   主旨题。对话开头男士就提到了问题，即说明书不够；随后又补充说明细节，有的包里什么说明书都没有，所以选C。 24．D   细节题。答案见划线部分。 25．A   细节题。男士明显很满意，因为他说that would be great。

Passage 1 
　　Attracting and feeding wild birds are entertaining activities that have long been enjoyed by people all over the world. (26) Feeding birds has become so popular that prepared feed mixtures are readily available. We feed birds for many reasons. Many pleasant hours can come from watching birds. A hobby often develops into a serious study of their habits. Accurate identification of birds is usually the first goal. But observations that an amateur bird-watcher can make are really limitless. There is, however, responsibility associated with bird feeding, including a disease hazard. Attracting numbers of birds continually to the same spot can be harmful to them, particularly species that pick food from the ground contaminated by the droppings of other birds. (27) In winter feeding efforts are most satisfying to people and are of greatest benefit to birds. During this time when fewer natural foods are available and air temperatures are lower, extra feeding can keep a bird warm and well. Once begun, feeding should never stop during these lean months. (28) If you start a local increase of birds, be prepared to do what may be required to eliminate hazards to those you want to befriend. A constant supply of food should be given until the cold is over and spring has come. (28) If feeding is stopped during severe weather, birds used to relying upon the feeders might starve.
Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
26. What does the speaker say about bird watching?
27. What does the speaker say about birds fed continually on the same spot?
28. What does the speaker suggest we do in feeding birds in winter?
　　本文是一篇关于喂食鸟类的说明文，重点讨论喂食对鸟类的好处与好处，并提出在冬天喂食并持续到天气转暖是对鸟类最有益处的。本文的语言稍难，但找到问题的答案并不难。
语言点：Prepared feed mixtures 混合饲料  Amateur 业余爱好者  Hazard 危险  Contaminate 污染  Dropping 粪便
Lean 贫乏的  Eliminate 消除  Befriend 与…成为朋友
26．A   细节题。答案在文章第一句，用词相同：Attracting and feeding wild birds are entertaining activities。
27．B   细节题。本题稍有难度，因为原文中提到birds fed continually on the same spot时并没有直接说明有可能染病，而是说pick food from the ground contaminated by the droppings of other birds（吃地上已经被别的鸟类粪便污染的食物），而这与上一句话相呼应，是一个disease hazard（疾病危险），所以选B，they may catch some disease。
28．D   细节题。原文中两处提到了冬天喂食鸟类须注意的地方，见划线部分。
Passage 2 
　　My friend Leo makes up weak and poor excuses whenever there is something he doesn't want to do. (29) Just two weeks ago, he was at my house when he decided he didn't want to go into work. He called his boss and said he had to get a new set of tires put on his truck. Then he sat down and watched TV with me. Not only had he lied but his excuse wasn't a very convincing one. Another time, he cancelled a date with his girlfriend at the last minute telling her he had to get a new battery for his truck. She was angry and refused to go out with him again until he apologized. (30) Last weekend, Leo offered the poorest excuse yet. He'd promised he'd help me move some furniture, (40) from my parents' house to my new apartment. He was supposed to bring his truck over about 8 o'clock Saturday morning. I waited, and then called and left a message on his machine. About 11:30, he called and said he was sorry but he'd been getting a new set of tires put on his truck. I guess he'd forgotten he used the same excuse when he called his boss from my house. I think I need a new set of friends. I'm beginning to get tired of Leo's excuses.
Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
29. What does the speaker tell us about her friend Leo?
30. What did his girlfriend do when Leo canceled a date with her at the last minute?
31. What favor did the speaker ask Leo to do last weekend?
　　本文是一篇对Leo的描述性说明文，通过三个例子说明只要有Leo不想做的事，他都会编造蹩脚的借口来推托搪塞。本文的语言和题目都比较简单。
29．C   主旨题。答案见划线部分。A选项是干扰项，he will betray（背叛） even his best friends，貌似正确，但make up poor and weak excuses（编造蹩脚的借口）远没有betray严重。
30．A   细节题。原文中说的是She was angry and refused to go out with him again until he apologized.（她拒绝跟Leo约会，直到他道歉），可见答案为A，she made him apologize（逼迫他道歉）。 31．D   细节题。答案见划线部分。
Passage 3 
　　In Hollywood, everybody wants to be rich, famous and beautiful. Nobody wants to be old, unknown and poor. For Hollywood kids, life can be difficult because they grow up in such an unreal atmosphere. (32) Their parents are ambitious and the children are part of the parents' ambitions. Parents pay for wasteful grand parties, expensive cars and designer clothes. When every dream can come true, kids don't learn the value of anything because they have everything. (33) A thirteen-year-old boy, Trent Maguire, has a driver, credit cards and unlimited cash to do what he wants when he wants to. "One day, I'll earn more than my dad!" he boasts. Parents buy care and attention for their children because they have no time to give it themselves. (34) Amender's mother employs a personal trainer, a bodyguard, a singing coach and a councilor to look after all her fifteen-year-old daughter's needs. Often, there is no parent at home most days, so children decide whether to make their own meals or go out to restaurants, when to watch television or do homework. They organize their own social lives. They play no childhood games. They become adults before they're ready. Hollywood has always been the city of dreams. The kids there live unreal lives where money, beauty and pleasure are the only gods. (35) Will children around the world soon start to think the same? Or do they already?
Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
32. Why is life said to be difficult for Hollywood kids?
33. What does the speaker say about Trent Maguire, a thirteen-year-old boy?
34. Why does Amender's mother employ other people to look after her needs?
35. What will probably have negative effects on the lives of Hollywood kids?

Section 3
　　Around 120 years ago, Ebbinghaus began his study of memory. He concentrated on studying how quickly the human mind can remember information. One result of his research is known as the total time hypothesis, which simply means the amount you learn depends on the time you spend trying to learn it. This can be taken as our first rule of learning. 
　　Although it is usually true that studying for four hours is better than studying for one, there is still the question of how we should use the four hours. For example, is it better to study for four hours straight or to study for one hour a day for four days in a row? The answer, as you may have suspected, is that it is better to spread out the study times. This phenomenon through which we can learn more efficiently by dividing our practice time is known as the distribution of practice effect. Thus, our second rule of learning is this: it's better to study fairly briefly but often. 
　　But we are not finished yet. We haven't considered how we should study over very short periods of time. Let's say you are trying to learn some new and rather difficult English vocabulary using a stack of cards. Should you look at the same word in rapid succession or look at the word and then have some delay before you look at it again? The answer is it is better to space up the presentations of the word you are to learn.
36. concentrated   原句空缺谓语，并与on搭配。Concentrate on“专注于”。注意时态应用过去时。37. information 
38. depends   原句空缺谓语，并与on搭配。Depend on“专注于”。主语为amount，注意应用第三人称单数。
39. straight   这里straight是“一直地”意思。 40. row   固定短语搭配，in a row“连续”。
41. suspected   “猜想”。注意原句是现在完成时态，所以用过去分词形式。
42. phenomenon   “现象”。此处是单数，有指示代词this，切记不要写成复数形式phemomena。 43. efficiently
44. our second rule of learning is this: it is better to study fairly briefly but often或者：2nd rule of learning: better to study briefly but often
45. Let’s say you are trying to learn some new and rather difficult English vocabulary using a stack of cards
　.或者：example: learn new English words with cards
46. The answer is it is better to space out the presentations of the word you are to learn.或者：better to learn new words at intervals 
提示：44-46考察考生的听写能力。建议在第一遍分辨句型，判断句子结构，听懂句子大意；第二遍是关键，应该写下句子的主干，此时尽可能多写；第三遍是检查阶段，补充剩余句子成分，尽可能使句子完整。如果不能完全按照原文记下来，可以根据原文意思用自己的语言表述。在听写整句时，要学会使用缩略语，在听第二遍第三遍时再将整句写上。

49. F  especially“特别是”。本空是解释说明的补语，用副词；而且后句解释英文词汇尤其丰富，所以用especially。
50. E  Enormous“巨大的”。本句是一个比喻，将会说英文而不会写作比喻成身处豪宅而不能离开一间斗室，这里应该是与small room反义的词，即enormous mansion。 
51. H  Mission“任务”。 本空与物主代词my共同构成句子主语，一定是名词；句子讲的是老师应该做什么，并且与下一句的task同义，所以选mission。

Section Two 
Passage One 
原文分析：
	本文是一篇说明文（exposition），讲的是时尚界的绿色风潮。第一段，作者用一次成功的绿色时装展引出话题；第二段，讨论了绿色设计师面临的问题，主要是有机面料难以获得；第三段例举了绿色设计师获得的多方支持，而最后一段则引述了某些人对绿色设计并不乐观的看法。最后，作者表明了自己的态度，即绿色设计最终会获得大部分消费者的认同。本文语言不难，虽然有一些专业词汇，但并不影响理解。
难句分析：
1．The January fashion show, called Future Fashion, exemplified how far green design has come.
一月份举行的名为“未来时尚”的时装展证明了绿色时尚的成就。本句的难点是how far green design has come，这里是“有多大成就”的意思。
2．Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren’t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you’re doing and what your customers are used to.
大部分现有品牌的设计师发现现在没有可以比得上、并且立刻代替他们正在使用且消费者熟悉的面料。
本句的句子结构比较复杂，宾语从句there aren’t comparable fabrics中有修饰fabrics的定语从句that can just replace…，而replace后则是两个并列的宾语从句what you’re doing and what your customers are used to。
关键词汇： sustainable 可持续的  Organic 有机的  Fabrics 面料  Line 系列设计/商品  Comparable 比得上的
Indistinguishable 无法区分的  Synthetics 合成材料  Stretch nylon 弹性尼龙  Equivalent 对等物
Unconverted 未被说服的  convert“使转变”  On the hunt for sth. 在寻找某物
57. A  细节题。答案在第一段，the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time，A选项只是用start going green代替了work with sustainable fabrics for the first time。
58. D  总结题。答案在第二段，讨论了绿色设计师面临的问题，文中首先简述了问题，即high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to find，随后又引用Scott Hahn的话进行详细解释（见难句分析2），最后指出some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents. 综合起来，选D。
59. D  总结题。本题考的是第三段的主要内容，从topic sentence即可看出答案为D：Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support，随后给出例证。A、B、C选项都是具体的例证。
60. A  细节题。答案在最后一段。Natalie是一个unconverted consumer（未被说服的消费者），而且承认green just isn’t yet on her mind（没想过）。
61. B  态度题。作者在全文最后明确提出了自己的态度：But – thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers – one day it will be. （总有一天，消费者会意识到绿色服装的重要性）。而且从文章的语气可以看出，作者是赞同绿色时尚的。
Passage Two 
原文分析：
	本文是一篇科学说明文（scientific exposition），介绍科学家的一项新发现，即通过对头发中水的成分的分析来大致判断个人活动的区域及途径。文章先介绍了这项发现的原理，饮用水会在头发中留下痕迹，而因为美国各地天气状况不一样，雨水中的化学成分各有差别，这样通过分析头发中水的成分可以大致确定某人在哪些时间段到过哪些地方。文章后半部分用一个具体的例子来说明这项发现可以用于帮助警方追踪嫌疑犯或受害者。
难句分析：
1. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. 
通过对一缕头发中重氢氧同位素比例的分析，科学家们可以构造一条地理时间线。一英寸头发相当于两个月。
2. They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems.
他们能够准确地将头发样品与某个大的区域对应起来，而这些区域的分布大致与降雨系统的活动一致。 
关键词汇：Chemical composition 化学成分  Trace 痕迹
62. B  主旨题。本题问的是文章的主题，文章第一句就明确了主题：Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair（通过一缕头发就能大致确定某人在哪里居住过），选B。
63. C  理解题。You’re what you eat and drink这句话通常指饮食对人体健康的影响，但在本文中，科学家引用这句话意在说明饮用水会在头发里留下化学痕迹，所以选C。
64. B  理解题。原文为：The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah. （最重的雨最先落下，所以，在太平洋上空形成的风暴在加州降下的雨比犹他州重）。关键在第一句话，答案则是反说，the water it delivers becomes lighter when it moves inland（雨水越向内陆前进越轻）。两者意思相同，表达方式相反。
65. A  细节题。答案在文章中段：Cerling’s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional differences.
66. C  细节题。Cerling首先提到了这项研究的实际作用，即“It’s not good for pinpointing … It’s good for eliminating many possibilities.” （不适用于精确定位，更适用于剔除很多可能性）；文章结尾警察也确认了这一用处：it narrows it way down for me（缩小了搜索范围），所以选C。

74. B  连词辨析题。Unless“除非”，if“如果”，as“当”，after“在…之后”。
75. D  搭配题。Low“低”，slight“少”，broad“广”，large“大”。Larger drops“更大的下滑”。

88．would not have been caught in the rain
要点：1）时态：从状语从句看出，这里用的是与过去情况相反的虚拟语气，所以用would have done。
　　　2）“被雨淋”：be caught in the rain
89．are more likely to gain/put on weight
要点：1）“更有可能”：用likely而不用possible;  2）“增加体重”：用put on weight或者gain weight都可以
90．What many people haven’t realized / What many people haven’t become aware of / What has not come to many people’s minds / What has not occurred to many people
要点：1）主语从句：需要翻译的部分是一个what引导的主语从句。 2）时态：这里用现在完成时态比一般现在时态更合适。
3）“意识到”：这个词有很多种翻译方法，具体见答案；特别需要注意的是用的词组不同，主语的搭配不一样，例如occur to主语为sth，而realize主语为sb。
91．closely related to the lack of exercise
要点：1）“与…密切相关”：relate … to …; 注意这里是被动语态，助动词is已写出。
2）“缺乏锻炼”：the lack of exercise。这里lack是名词，定冠词the不可缺；其实也可以用lack的动名词形式：lacking exercise，但为了与主语the poor functioning of the human body对应，the lack of exercise更好。

That’s enough, kids
　　It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.
　　“I’d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he’d shoved,” she says.” I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, ’No, we don’t push,” What happened next was unexpected.
　　“The boy’s mother ran toward me from across the park,” Stella says,” I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for disciplining her child, All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted, hurting other children in the process?”
　　Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people’s children has become a minefield.
　　In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister’s house it’s encouraged. For her, it’s about kids being kids: “If you can’t do it at three, when can you do it?”
　　Each of these philosophies is valid and, it has to be said, my son loves visiting his aunt’s house. But I find myself saying “no” a lot when her kids are over at mine. That’s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous territory when you’re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.
　　“Kids aren’t all raised the same,” agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University.” But there is still an idea that they’re the property of the parent. We see our children as an extension of ourselves, so if you’re saying that my child is behaving inappropriately, then that’s somehow a criticism of me.”
　　In those circumstances, it’s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two schools of thought.
　　“I’d go to the child first,” says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. Usually a quiet reminder that ’we don’t do that here’ is enough. Kids nave finely tuned antennae (直觉) for how to behave in different settings.”
　　He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel neglectful, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.
　　This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents if they’re there and ask them to deal with it,” she says.    
　　Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: “Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Preface your remarks with something like: ’I know you’ll think I’m silly but in my house I don’t want…’”
　　When it comes to situations where you’re caring for another child, white is straightforward: “common sense must prevail. If things don’t go well, then have a chat.”
　　There’re a couple of new grey areas. Physical punishment, once accepted from any adult, is no longer appropriate. “A new set of considerations has come to the fore as part of the debate about how we handle children.”
　　For Andrew Fuller, the child-centric nature of our society has affected everyone:” The rules are different now from when today’s parents were growing up,” he says, “Adults are scared of saying: ’don’t swear’, or asking a child to stand up on a bus. They’re worried that there will be conflict if they point these things out – either from older children, or their parents.”
　　He sees it as a loss of the sense of common public good and public courtesy (礼貌), and says that adults suffer form it as much as child.
　　Meredith Fuller agrees: “A code of conduct is hard to create when you’re living in a world in which everyone is exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, and a world in which nice people are perceived to finish last.”
　　“It’s about what I’m doing and what I need,” Andrew Fuller says. ”the days when a kid came home from school and said, “I got into trouble”. And dad said, ‘you probably deserved it’. Are over. Now the parents are charging up to the school to have a go at teachers.”
　　This jumping to our children’s defense is part of what fuels the “walking on eggshells” feeling that surrounds our dealings with other people’s children. You know that if you remonstrate(劝诫) with the child, you’re going to have to deal with the parent. It’s admirable to be protective of our kids, but is it good?
　　“Children have to learn to negotiate the world on their own, within reasonable boundaries,” White says. “I suspect that it’s only certain sectors of the population doing the running to the school –better –educated parents are probably more likely to be too involved.”
　　White believes our notions of a more child-centered, it’ a way of talking about treating our children like commodities(商品). We’re centered on them but in ways that reflect positively on us. We treat them as objects whose appearance and achievements are something we can be proud of, rather than serve the best interests of the children.”
　　One way over-worked, under-resourced parents show commitment to their children is to leap to their defence. Back at the park, Bianchi’ intervention(干预) on her son’ behalf ended in an undignified exchange of insulting words with the other boy’ mother.
　　As Bianchi approached the park bench where she’d been sitting, other mums came up to her and congratulated her on taking a stand. “Apparently the boy had a longstanding reputation for bad behaviour and his mum for even worse behaviour if he was challenged.”
　　Andrew Fuller doesn’t believe that we should be afraid of dealing with other people’s kids. “look at kids that aren’t your own as a potential minefield,” he says. He recommends that we don’t stay silent over inappropriate behaviour, particularly with regular visitors.

Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　If you are a male and you are reading this ,congratulations: you are a survivor .According to statistics .you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman ,and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you will die on average five years before a woman.
　　There are many reasons for this-typically, men take more risks than woman and are more likely to drink and smoke but perhaps more importantly, men don’t go to the doctor.
   “Men aren’t seeing doctors as often as they should, ” says Dr. Gullotta, “This is particularly so for the over-40s,when diseases tend to strike.”
　　Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45,it should be at least once a year.
　　Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old ma who had delayed doing anything about his smoker’s cough for a year.
   “When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer” he says, “Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged this life”
　　According to a recent survey, 95%of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.
   “A lot of men think they are invincible （不可战胜的）”Gullotta says “They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think” Geez, if it could happen to him.
　　Then there is the ostrich approach,” some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know, ” says Dr. Ross Cartmill.
　　“Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,” Cartmill says .He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.
　　Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says.” But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.”
57.Why does the author congratulate his male readers at the beginning of the passage?
A. They are more likely to survive serious diseases today.
B. Their average life span has been considerably extended.
C. They have lived long enough to read this article.
D. They are sure to enjoy a longer and happier live.
58.What does the author state is the most important reason men die five years earlier on average than women?
A. men drink and smoke much more than women
B. men don’t seek medical care as often as women
C. men aren’t as cautions as women in face of danger
D. men are more likely to suffer from fatal diseases
59. Which of the following best completes the sentence “Geez, if it could happen to him…’(line2,para,8)?
A. it could happen to me, too
B. I should avoid playing golf
C. I should consider myself lucky
D. it would be a big misfortune
60what does Dr. Ross Cartmill mean by “the ostrich approach”(line q para.9)
A. a casual attitude towards one’s health conditions
B. a new therapy for certain psychological problems
C. refusal to get medical treatment for fear of the pain involved
D. unwillingness to find out about one’s disease because of fear
61. What does Cartmill say about regular check-ups for men?
A.They may increase public expenses
B.They will save money in the long run
C.They may cause psychological strains on men
D.They will enable men to live as long as women
Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　High-quality customer service is preached(宣扬) by many ,but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than done
　　Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store, but instead will alert their friends, relatives, co-workers, strangers-and anyone who will listen.
　　Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers decide t frequent their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde group and Wharton school
   “Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains consumers,” said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde group.” the store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.”
　　On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four other, and will no longer visit the specific store for every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative reviews. The resulting “snowball effect” can be disastrous to retailers.
　　According to the research, shoppers who purchased clothing encountered the most problems. ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers.
　　The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered (塞满了的) shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.
　　During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved the parking problems by getting moonlighting（业余兼职的）local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance eliminated the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided confrontation between those eyeing the same parking space.
　　Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.
　　Most importantly, salespeople should be diplomatic and polite with angry customers.
　　“Retailers who’re responsive and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren’t so friendly.” said Professor Stephen Hoch. “Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.”
　　Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by filing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. Retailers are hard-pressed to improve when they have no idea what is wrong.
注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答
62. Why are store managers often the last to hear complaints?
A Most customers won’t bother to complain even if they have had unhappy experiences.
B Customers would rather relate their unhappy experiences to people around them.
C Few customers believe the service will be improved.
D Customers have no easy access to store managers.
63. What does Paula Courtney imply by saying “ … the shopper must also find a replacement” (Line 2, Para. 4)?
A New customers are bound to replace old ones.
B It is not likely the shopper can find the same products in other stores.
C Most stores provide the same
D Not complaining to the manager causes the shopper some trouble too.
64. Shop owners often hire moonlighting police as parking attendants so that shoppers_____
A can stay longer browsing in the store
B won’t have trouble parking their cars
C won’t have any worries about security
D can find their cars easily after shopping
65. What contributes most to smoothing over issues with customers?

B Hiring of efficient employees
C Huge supply of goods for sale
D Design of the store layout.
66. To achieve better shopping experiences, customers are advised to _________.

C voice their dissatisfaction to store managers directly

Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes)

Media Selection for Advertisements
   After determining the target audience for a product or service, advertising agencies must select the appropriate media for the advertisement. We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus on attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail.
Television
   Television in an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it.
   Television’s influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. the Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous (具有共同特点的) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers. This had also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.
Newspapers
   After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual as revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (发行量) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium.
   Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the message out. Newspapers are often the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.
Radio
   Advertising on radio continues to grow. Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor bill-boards (广告牌) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.
   Two major changes—satellite and Internet radio—will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart.
Magazines
   Newsweeklies, women’s titles, and business magazines have all seen increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television attracts all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read Sports Illustrated, for example, you have such in common with the magazine’s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.
   Advertisers using the print media—magazines and newspapers—will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed (分散) than in the past. Second, advertisers will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.
Out-of-home advertising
   Out-of-home advertising, also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly effective way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for advertising is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. Using the digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.
Internet
   As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease. The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.
   Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations’ advertising in the near future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the inline medium as well.
Direct mail
   A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client’s message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards, and special promotion. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective form of advertising.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)  (25 minutes)

Section A
   Some years ago I was offered a writing assignment that would require three months of travel through Europe. I had been abroad a couple of times, but I could hardly _47_ to know my way around the continent. Moreover, my knowledge of foreign languages was _48_ to a little college French.
   I hesitated. How would I, unable to speak the language, _49_ unfamiliar with local geography or transportation systems, set up _50_ and do research? It seemed impossible, and with considerable _51_ I sat down to write a letter begging off. Halfway through, a thought can through my mind: you can learn if you don’t try. So I accepted the assignment.
   There were some bad _52_. But by the time I had finished the trip I was an experienced traveler. And ever since, I have never hesitated to head for even the most remote of places, without guiders or even _53_ bookings, confident that somehow I will manage.
   The point is that the new, the different, is almost by definition _54_. But each time you try something, you learn, and as the learning piles up, the world opens to you.
   I’ve learned to ski at 40, and flown up the Rhine River in a _55_. And I know I’ll go on doing such things. It’s not because I’m braver or more daring than others. I’m not. But I’ll accept anxiety as another name for challenge and I believe I can _56_ wonders.

Section B
Passage One
   Global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the 21st century, but regardless of whether it is or isn’t –we won’t do much about it.  We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed.
   Al Gore calls global warming an “inconvenient truth,” as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don’t know enough to relieve global warming, and –without major technological breakthroughs—we can’t do much about it.
   From 2003 to 2050, the world’s population is projected to grow from 6.4 billion to 9.1 billion, a 42% increase. If energy use per person and technology remain the same, total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (mainly, CO2) will be 42% higher in 2050. but that’s too low, because societies that grow richer use more energy. We need economic growth unless we condemn the world’s poor to their present poverty and freeze everyone else’s living standards. With modest growth, energy use and greenhouse emissions more than double by 2050.
   No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and personal freedom (limits on electricity usage, driving and travel) that might cut back global warming. Still, politicians want to show they’re “doing something.” Consider the Kyoto Protocol (京都议定书). It allowed countries that joined to punish those that didn’t. But it hasn’t reduced CO2 emissions (up about 25% since 1990), and many signatories (签字国) didn’t adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012 targets.
   The practical conclusion is that if global warming is a potential disaster, the only solution is new technology. Only an aggressive research and development program might find ways of breaking dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it.
The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a moral problem when it’s really an engineering one. The inconvenient truth is that if we don’t solve the engineering problem, we’re helpless.
57. What is said about global warming in the first paragraph?

A) It may not prove an environmental crisis at all. 
B) It is an issue requiring world wide commitments.
C) Serious steps have been taken to avoid or stop it.
D) Very little will be done to bring it under control.

58. According to the author’s understanding, what is Al Gore’s view on global warming?
A) It is a reality both people and politicians are unaware of.
B) It is a phenomenon that causes us many inconveniences.
C) It is a problem that can be solved once it is recognized.
D) It is an area we actually have little knowledge about.
59. Green house emissions will more than double by 2050 because of _______.

A) economic growth
B) the widening gap between the rich and poor
C) wasteful use of energy
D) the rapid advances of science and technology

60. The author believes that, since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, ________.
A) politicians have started to do something to better the situation
B) few nations have adopted real tough measures to limit energy use
C) reductions in energy consumption have greatly cut back global warming
D) international cooperation has contributed to solving environmental problems
61. What is the message the author intends to convey?
A) Global warming is more of a moral issue than a practical one.
B) The ultimate solution to global warming lies in new technology
C) The  debate over global warming will lead to technological breakthroughs.
D) People have to give up certain material comforts to stop global warming.
Passage Two
   Someday a stranger will read your e-mail without your permission or scan the Websites you’ve visited. Or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchase or cell phone bills to find out your shopping preferences or calling habits.
   In fact, it’s likely some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permission? It might be a spouse, a girlfriend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen — the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked.
   Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, that it’s important to reveal yourself to friends, family and lovers in stages, at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain. The digital bread crumbs (碎屑) you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can reveal what you think. Like it or not, increasingly we live in a world where you simple cannot keep a secret.
   The key question is: Does that matter?
   When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most say they are concerned about losing it. A survey found an overwhelming pessimism about privacy, with 60 percent of respondents saying they feel their privacy is “slipping away, and that bothers me.”
   But people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny fraction of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths (收费站) to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that can track automobile movements. And few turn down supermarket loyalty cards. Privacy economist Alessandro Acquisti has run a series of tests that reveal people will surrender personal information like Social Security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cents-off coupon (优惠券).
   But privacy does matter – at least sometimes. It’s like health: When you have it, you don’t notice it. Only when it’s gone do you wish you’d done more to protect it.
62. What does the author mean by saying “the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked ”(Lines 3-4, Para.2)?
A) People’s personal information is easily accessed without their knowledge.
B) In the 21st century people try every means to look into others’ secrets.
C) People tend to be more frank with each other in the information age.
D) Criminals are easily caught on the spot with advanced technology.
63. What would psychologists advise on the relationships between friends?

A) Friends should open their hearts to each other.
B) Friends should always be faithful to each other.
C) There should be a distance even between friends.
D) There should be fewer disputes between friends.

64. Why does the author say “we live in a world where you simple cannot keep a secret” (Line 5, Para.3)?
A) Modern society has finally evolved into an open society.
B) People leave traces around when using modern technology.
C) There are always people who are curious about others’ affairs.
D) Many search engines profit by revealing people’s identities.
65. What do most Americans do with regard to privacy protection?
A) They change behaviors that might disclose their identity.
B) They use various loyalty cards for business transactions.

C) They rely more and more on electronic devices.
D) They talk a lot but hardly do anything about it.

66. According to the passage, privacy is like health in that ________.

A) people will make every effort to keep it
B) its importance is rarely understood
C) it is something that can easily be lost
D) people don’t cherish it until they lose it

 Part Ⅱ Rading comprehension (Skimming and scanning) (15minutes)
Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passsage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B),C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.
Univeraities Branch Out
     As never before in their long story, universities have become instruments of national 
competition as well as instruments of peace. They are the place of the scientific discoveries that 
move economies forward, and the primary means of educating the talent required to obtain and 
maintain competitive advantages. But at the same time, the opening of national borders to the flow 
of goods, services, information and especially people has made universities a powerful force for 
global integration, mutual understanding and geopolitical stability.
   In response to the same forces that have driven the world economy, universities have become 
More self-consciousy global: seeking students from around the world who represent the entire 
range of cultures and values, sending their own students abroad to prepare them for global careers, 
offering courses of study that address the challenges of an interconnected world and collaborative
（合作的）research programs to advance science for the benefit of all humanity.
Of the forces shaping higher education none is more sweeping than the movement across borders. Over the past three decades the number of students leaving home each year to study abroad has grown at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, from 8000,000 in 1975 to 2.5 million in 2994. Most travel from one developed nation to another, but the flow from developing to developed countries id growing rapidly. The reverse flow, from developed to developing countries, is on the rise, too. Today foreign students earn 30 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in the United States and 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom. And the number crossing borders for undergraduate study is growing as well, to 8 percent of the undergraduates at America’s best institutions and 10 percent of all undergraduates in the U.K. In the United States, 20 percent of the newly hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born, and in China many newly hired faculty hired faculty members at the top research universities received their graduate education abroad.
	Universities are also encouraging students to spend some of their undergraduate years in another country. In Europe, more than 140,000 students participate in the Erasmus program each year, taking courses for credit in one of 2, 2000 participating institutions across the continent. And in the United States, institutions are helping place students in summer internships（实习）abroad to prepare them for global careers. Yale and Harvard have led the way, offering every undergraduate at least one international study or internship opportunity and providing the financial resources to make it possible.
　　Globalization is also reshaping the way research is done. One new trend involves sourcing portions of a research program to another country. Yale professor and Howard Hughes Medical Shanghai’s Fudan University, in collaboration with faculty colleagues from both schools. The Shanghai center has 95 employees and graduate students working in a 4,300-square-meter laboratory seminars with scientists from both campuses. The arrangement benefits both countries;
Xu’s Yale lab is more productive, thanks to the lower costs of conducing from a word-class scientist and his U.S. team.
　　As a result of its strength in science, the United States has consistently led of the world in the world in the commercialization of major new technologies, from the mainframe computer and integrated circuit of the 1960s to the internet infrastructure(基础设施)and applications software of 
the 1990s.The link between university-based science and industrial application is often indirect but sometimes highly visible: Silicon Valley was intentionally created by Stanford University, and
Route 128 outside Boston has long housed companies spun off from MIT and Harvard. Around the world ,governments have encouraged copying of his model, perhaps most successfully in Cambridge, England, where Microsoft and scores of other leading software and biotechnology companies have set up shop around the university.
　　For all its success, the United States remains deeply hesitant about sustaining the research university model. Most politician recognize the link between investment in science and national 
Economic strength, but support for research funding has been unsteady. The budget of the National Institutes of Health doubled between 1998 and 2003,but has risen more slowly than inflations since then. Support for the physical sciences and engineering barely kept pace with inflation during that same period. The attempt to make up lost ground is welcome, but the nation would be better served by steady, predictable increases in science funding at the rate of long-term GDP growth, which is on the order of inflation plus 3 percent per year.
　　American politicians have great difficulty recognizing that admitting more foreign students can greatly promote the national interest by increasing international understanding. Adjusted for inflation, public funding for international exchanges and foreign-language study is well below the levels of 40 years ago. In the wake of September 11,changes in the visa process caused a dramatic decline in the number of foreign students seeking admission to U.S. Universities, and a corresponding surge in enrollments in Australia, Singapore and the U .K. Objections from Americans university and business leaders led to improvements in the process and a reversal of the decline ,but the United States is still seen by many as unwelcoming to international students.
　　Most Americans recognize that universities contribute to the nation’s well-being through their scientific research, but many fear that foreign students threaten American competitiveness by taking their knowledge and skills back home. They fail to grasp that welcoming foreign students and like immigrants throughout history-strength the nation; and second, foreign students who study in the United States become ambassadors for many of its most cherished(珍视) values when they return home. Or at least they understand them better. In America as elsewhere, few Instruments of foreign policy are as effective in promoting peace and stability as welcoming international university students.

Passage One 
Questions 57 to 61 are based on following passage.

By almost any measure , there is a boom in Internet-based instruction . In just a few years , 34 percent of American universities have begun offering some form of distance learning (DL), and among the larger schools , it’s closer to 90 percent . If you doubt the popularity of the trend, you probably haven’t . It enrolls 90,000 student , a statistic used to support its claim to be the largest private university in the country.
While the kinds of instruction offered in these programs will differ, DL usually signifies a course in which the instructions post syllabi(课程大纲), reading assignments , and schedules on Websites , and students send in their assignments by e-mail . Generally speaking , face-to-face communication with an instructor is minimized or eliminated altogether.
The attraction for students might at first seem obvious . Primarily , there’s the convenience promised by courses on the Net: you can do the work, as they say , in your pajamas(睡衣). But figures indicate that the reduced effort results in a reduced commitment to the course . While dropout rates for all freshmen at American universities is around 20 percent , the rate for online students is 35 percent . Students themselves seem to understand the weaknesses inherent in the setup . In a survey conducted for eCornell , the DL division of Cornell University , less than a third of the respondents expected the quality of the online course to be as good as the classroom course.
Cleary form the schools perspective , there’s a lot of money to be saved . Although some of the more ambitious programs require new investments in servers and networks to support collaborative software , most DL courses can run on existing or minimally upgraded(升级)systems . The more students who enroll in a course but don’t come to campus , the more the school saves on keeping the lights on in the classrooms , paying doorkeepers , and maintaining parking lots , And there’s evindence that instructors must work harder to run a DL course for a variety of reasons , won’t be paid any more , and might well be paid less.

Passage Two
Questions62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
In this age of Internet chat, videogames and reality television, there is no shortage of mindless activities to keep a child occupied. Yet, despite the competition, my 8-year-old daughter Rebecca wants to spend her leisure time writing short stories. She wants to enter one of her stories into a writing contest, a competition she won last yes.
As a writer I know about winning contest, and about losing them. I know what it is like to work hard on a story only to receive a rejection slip from the publisher. I also know the pressures of trying to live up to a reputation created by previous victories. What if she doesn’t win the contest again? That’s the strange thing about being a parent. So many of our own past scars and dashed hopes can surface.
A revelation（启示）came last week when I asked her, “Don’t you want to win again?” “No,” she replied, “I just want to tell the story of an angel going to first grade.”
I had just spent weeks correcting her stories as she spontaneously（自由地）told them. Telling myself that I was merely an experienced writer guiding the young writer across the hall, I offered suggestions for characters, conflicts and endings for her tales. The story about a fearful angel starting first trade was quickly “guided” by me into the tale of a little girl with a wild imagination taking her fist music lesson. I had turned her contest into my contest without even realizing it.
　Staying back and giving kids space to grow is not as easy as it looks. Because I konw very little about farm animals who use tools or angels who go to first grade, I had to accept the fact that I was co-opting（借用）my daughter’s experence.
   While stepping back was difficult for me, it was certainly a good first step that I will quickly follow with more steps, putting myself far enough away to give her room but close enough to help if asked. All the while I will be reminding myself that children need room to experiment, grow and find their own voices.

   D) A lot of distractions compete for children’s time nowadays.

Can Digital Textbooks Truly Replace the Print Kind?

The shortcomings of traditional print edition textbooks are obvious: For starters they're heavy, with the average physics textbook weighing 3.6 pounds. They're also expensive, especially when you factor in the average college student's limited budget, typically costing hundreds of dollars every semester.
But the worst part is that print versions of textbooks are constantly undergoing revisions. Many professors require that their students use only the latest versions in the classroom, essentially rendering older texts unusable. For students, it means they're basically stuck with a four pound paperweight that they can't sell back.
Which is why digital textbooks, if they live up to their promise, could help ease many of these shortcomings. But till now, they've been something like a mirage(幻影) in the distance, more like a hazy(模糊的) dream than an actual reality. Imagine the promise: Carrying all your textbooks in a 1.3 pound iPad? It sounds almost too good to be true.
But there are a few pilot schools already making the transition(过渡) over to digital books. Universities like Cornell and Brown have jumped onboard. And one medical program at the University of California, Irvine, gave their entire class iPads with which to download textbooks just last year.
But not all were eager to jump aboard.
"People were tired of using the iPad textbook besides using it for reading." says Kalpit Shah, who will be going into his second year at Irvine's medical program this fall. "They weren't using it as a source of communication because they couldn't read or write in it. So a third of the people in my program were using the iPad in class to take notes, the other third were using laptops and the last third were using paper and pencil."
The reason it hasn't caught on yet, he tells me. is that the functionality of e-edition textbooks is incredibly limited, and some students just aren't motivated to learn new study behavior. 
But a new application called Inkling might change all that. The company just released an updated version last week, and it'll be utilized in over 50 undergraduate and graduate classrooms this coming school year.
"Digital textbooks are not going to catch on," says Inkling CEO Matt Maclnnis as he's giving me a demo(演示) over coffee. "What I mean by that is the current perspective of the digital textbook is it's an exact copy of the print book. There's Course Smart, etc., these guys who take an image of the page and put it on a screen. If that's how we're defining digital textbooks, there's no hope of that becoming a mainstream product."
He calls Inkling a platform for publishers to build rich multimedia content from the ground up, with a heavy emphasis on real-world functionality. The traditional textbook merely serves as a skeleton.
At first glance Inkling is an impressive experience. After swiping (触及) into the iPad app (应用软件), which you can get for free here, he opens up a few different types of textbooks.
Up first is a chemistry book. The boot time is pretty fast, and he navigates through (浏览) a few chapters before swiping into a fully rendered 3D molecule that can be spun around to view its various building blocks. "Publishers give us all of the source media, artwork, videos," he says. "We help them think through how to actually build something for this platform."
Next he pulls up a music composition textbook, complete with playable demos. It's a learning experience that attacks you from multiple sensory directions. It's clear why this would be something a music major would love.
But the most exciting part about Inkling, to me. is its notation (批注) system. Here's how it works:
When you purchase a used print book, it comes with its previous owner's highlights and notes in the margins. It uses the experience of someone who already went through the class to help improve your reading (how much you trust each notation is obviously up to you).
But with Inkling, you can highlight a piece of content and make notes. Here's where things get interesting, though: If a particularly important passage is highlighted by multiple Inkling users, that information is stored on the cloud and is available for anyone reading the same textbook to come across. That means users have access to notes from not only their classmates and Facebook friends, but anyone who purchased the book across the country. The best comments are then sorted democratically by a voting system, meaning that your social learning experience is shared with the best and brightest thinkers.
As a bonus, professors can even chime in (插话 ) on discussions. They’ll be able to answer the questions of students who are in their class directly via the interactive book.
Of course, Inkling addresses several of the other shortcomings in traditional print as well. Textbook versions are constantly updated, motivating publishers by minimizing production costs (the big ones like McGraw-Hill are already onboard). Furthermore, students will be able to purchase sections of the text instead of buying the whole thing, with individual chapters costing as little as $2.99.
There are, however, challenges.
“It takes efforts to build each book,” Maclnnis tells me. And it’s clear why.
Each interactive textbook is a media-heavy experience built from the ground up, and you can tell that it takes a respectable amount of manpower to put together each one.
For now the app is also iPad-exclusive, and though a few of these educational institutions are giving the hardware away for free, for other students who don’t have such a luxury it’s an added layer of cost — and an expensive one at that.
But this much is clear. The traditional textbook model is and has been broken for quite some time. Whether digitally interactive ones like Inkling actually take off or not remains to be seen, and we probably won’t have a definite answer for the next few years.
However the solution to any problem begins with a step in a direction. And at least for now, that hazy mirage in the distance? A little more tangible (可触摸的 ), a little less of a dream.

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 

Junk food is everywhere. We're eating way too much of it. Most of us know what we're doing and yet we do it anyway.
So here's a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it's displayed?
"Many policy measures to control obesity (肥胖症) assume that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat and therefore focus on providing information and more access to healthier foods," note the two researchers.
"In contrast," the researchers continue, "many regulations that don't assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol, a substance - like food - of which immoderate consumption leads to serious health problems."
The research references studies of people's behavior with food and alcohol and results of alcohol restrictions, and then lists five regulations that the researchers think might be promising if applied to junk foods. Among them:
Density restrictions: licenses to sell alcohol aren't handed out unplanned to all comers but are allotted (分配) based on the number of places in an area that already sell alcohol. These make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink.
Similarly, the researchers say, being presented with junk food stimulates our desire to eat it. So why not limit the density of food outlets, particularly ones that sell food rich in empty calories? And why not limit sale of food in places that aren't primarily food stores?
Display and sales restrictions: California has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can't buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they're easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines. The other measures include restricting portion sizes, taxing and prohibiting special price deals for junk foods, and placing warning labels on the products.

Passage Two 
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. 

Kodak's decision to file for bankruptcy (破产) protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution.
Although many attribute Kodak's downfall to "complacency (自满) , " that explanation doesn't acknowledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak anticipated that digital photography would overtake film - and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 - but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.
It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future, said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late.
Kodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching to new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses.
Although Kodak anticipated the inevitable rise of digital photography, its corporate culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.
Kodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace.

A) It went bankrupt all of a sudden.
B) It is approaching its downfall.

63. Why does the author mention Kodak's invention of the first digital camera?
A) To show its early attempt to reinvent itself.
B) To show its effort to overcome complacency.
C) To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution.
D) To show its will to compete with Japan's Fuji Photo.

For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage. 

School Lunch
Ryan moved silently through the lunch line. The cook put a cheeseburger (奶酪汉堡) and an applesauce cup on his tray. He grabbed a bottle of milk from the cooler at the end of the line and found a seat in the cafeteria (食堂). Ryan saw that his friend Tyler had brought lunch from home.
"What did you bring today, Tyler?" he asked.
Tyler pulled his meal out of its brown paper sack. "I've got a ham sandwich, chips, two cupcakes, and a can of soda."
Ryan's mouth started to water. "Uh, Tyler," he said. "If you don't want one of those cupcakes, I'll take it. They sure look good. "
Tyler handed Ryan his cupcake. "Sure," he said. "I won't eat all this."

Lunch Requirements
Is Ryan eating a healthy meal if he eats the school lunch? School lunch supporters say "Yes." Recent studies show that a government-approved school lunch has more variety and is more nutritious (有营养的) than most lunches brought from home. It's also lower in fat.
The National School Lunch Act requires that school lunches go along with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans developed by the government. Meals must contain a variety of foods with plenty of grains and at least one fruit or vegetable each day. Foods must not contain too much sugar or salt.
A hot lunch can contain up to 30% fat, but not more than 10% of its calories (卡路里) should come from saturated (饱和的) fat. In an average week, you should get one-third of the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances for protein, iron, calcium (钙), and vitamins A and C from your school lunch.

Dare to Compare
Let's compare Ryan's and Tyler's meals to sec which is healthier. Ryan's hot lunch (without the cupcake from his friend) has 577 calories, 25 grams of total fat. and 12 grams of saturated fat. He had one serving of fruit, 26 grams of protein, and 483 milligrams of calcium. Ryan ate more total fat (39%) and saturated fat (19%) than the dietary guidelines recommend. However, schools can still meet the guidelines by having the numbers average out over a week of lunches.
Tyler's lunch from home (this includes both cupcakes) had 1 014 calories. 45 grams (40%) of total fat, and 10 grams (9%) of saturated fat. He ate 21 grams of protein and 155 milligrams of calcium, but no fruits or vegetables. Tyler's meal met the saturated fat guidelines, but had too much total fat.
Tyler ate more calories and total fat than Ryan did. Ryan ate more protein, calcium, and fruit than Tyler did. Which meal would you say is the healthier choice?

? la Carte Options
Federal standards and most school districts forbid selling food in the cafeteria that competes with the school lunch. Many programs do, however, offer à la carte choices for students who don't want the hot meal. Foods sold à la carte separate from the main meal and are priced individually. These foods do not have to meet the same nutritional standards as the foods on the hot lunch menu. Neither do the foods sold at a snack-bar or those foods available elsewhere in the school.
A study in one Texas school district compared the lunches of fourth graders who did not have food choices with those of fifth graders who could choose either a standard lunch or select from a snack-bar. The fourth graders ate 25% more fruits and vegetables than the fifth graders.
Food sold as fund-raisers can also have an impact on school lunch. The money raised is important to provide needed funds for many after-class activities. But the meal's overall nutritional quality usually goes down. Many of these foods are high in fat, sugar, or both, and often come in extralarge portions. Fundraisers rarely sell fruits and vegetables.

Choosing Wisely
School food-service programs are trying to please students, and still offer quality, nutritious meals at low cost. That task isn't easy. One school district in New York decided to do something about it. A student advisory board kept the food-service director up-to-date on what the kids wanted. They also worked with school snack-bars to sell smaller servings of chips and candy.
You can make healthy meal choices at school even when not-so-healthy choices are available. You can be sure to get a nutritious meal when you pick foods from the Food Guide Pyramid. For example, always drink milk or a calcium-rich juice for lunch. Even chocolate milk is more nutritious than soda or a sports drink. Stay away from snack foods offered à la carte. They may fill you up now, but the ones that contain a lot of fat and sugar will slow you down later. Always eat the fruits and vegetables offered at the meal. They help give you the energy and vitamins you need to get you through the rest of your school day.
Some people like to make fun of school lunches, but good nutrition is no laughing matter. Your school's hot lunch is based on the Food Guide Pyramid, so it's full of nutrition. Give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.

It's a Team Effort 
Team Nutrition is a program that gets schools excited about healthy eating. Schools across the nation pick a team leader who develops fun nutrition activities. The leader works with students, teachers, parents, food-service workers, and people from the community. Activities can range from running a school health fair to planting a garden. 
At the Jordan Community School in Chicago, Illinois, one group of fifth graders showed off their "pizza(比萨饼)garden" in a big, colorful poster showing vegetarian pizzas. The students and food-service staff planted and took care of the vegetables that they would later use as ingredients on their pizzas. The group started growing the plants in the school's cafeteria. Then they moved them outdoors to the students' demonstration garden. 
This is just one way to get everyone involved in making school lunch healthy and fun. Team up with your own group and see how creative you can get.

Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage. 
It's the first question parents ask when their child is diagnosed with autism (自闭症). Will his future brothers or sisters have a higher risk of __47__ it, too?
According to the largest study of siblings (兄弟姐妹) in families with autism, the answer is yes. Among 664 children who had at least one older sibling with the developmental disorder, the __48__ risk of autism was nearly 19%, __49__ higher than previous sibling-recurrence estimates that were anywhere from 3% to 10%. Kids with more than one older autistic sibling had an even higher risk of the disorder: 32%.
The __50__ suggest that genes play a key role in autism risk. But they also hint that other environmental factors __51__ by siblings, like influences in the womb (子宫), may be important as well.
On the __52__ of the findings, the researchers recommend that doctors closely __53__ younger siblings of autistic children to pick up any early signs of the disorder, __54__ an unusually large head or delayed language development and communication skills. Evidence suggests that early __55__ and diagnosis of autism can help children take advantage of therapies that can treat some of its __56__.

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 

Libraries are my world. I've been a patron (老主顾) all my life, and for the past nine years I've worked at multiple libraries and archives in and around Detroit. The library as an institution has many roles, but as our country struggles through an economic crisis, I have watched the library where I work evolve into a career and business center, a community gathering place and a bastion (堡垒) of hope.
In the spring of 2007 1 got a library internship (实习生的位置) at the Southfield Public Library (SPL), just north of Detroit. Summers at SPL were usually slow, but that year, we experienced a library that was as busy as science-fair project week, midterms or tax season. Yet patrons weren't looking for Mosby's Nursing Drug Reference or tax return forms. They were coming for information on growing their small business.
I interpreted people's interest in our business collection as the first step to pursuing their dreams, but these patrons were not motivated by dreams. They were responding to reality, and they were looking for Plan B.
Things worsened in 2008, and in 2009 the economic crisis continues to plague Michigan. Last year, we put up a display with a variety of job resources that we restocked every hour. Each night the library closed, the display was bare. While we normally keep displays up for a week, we kept the job resources display up for months.
Then there's the tightening credit market. People see the writing on the wall and they want to get educated. They can't afford a financial adviser, but checking books out is free. Some of the most popular titles now are Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Think and Grow Rich, and Suze Orman's 2009 Action Plan.
The economic downturn affects us all. I have had to work long hours and don't get to see much of my boyfriend or experience any kind of social life lately, but I am thankful to be in a position where I can help people overcome this struggle. In Michigan, we haven't lost hope. As long as there are libraries here, there will always be hope.

Passage Two 
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. 

More than three dozen billionaires, including well-known philanthropist (慈善家) David Rockefeller, have promised at least half of their fortunes to charity, joining a programme that Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett started in June to encourage other wealthy people to give.
The pledge is currently worth about $ 150 billion, but the programme predicts it will eventually be worth $ 600 billion.
"During even the Depression's worst years, my parents gave money - about 8% of their annual income of $ 2200," said Lorry Lokey, one of the donors, on the website of the programme, the Giving Pledge, "I remember saying to my mother that we can't afford that. But she said we have to share with others."
The pledge has been a matter of some debate in philanthropic and non-profit circles, with some experts dismissing it as mere publicity and others predicting that it would produce a flood of new money to support non-profit groups.
Buffett said the real value of the pledge was found in the example it set and in the sentiments (情感) expressed in the letters posted on the website.
Buffett and Gates will hold several dinners later this year to recruit more billionaires, and members of the Giving Pledge will meet annually to discuss their philanthropy.
The pair are due to meet some wealthiest people in China next month and India in March.
"We hope this catches fire in some other countries," Buffett said, "If they want to take what we think is a good idea and run with it, we will be cheering."
Buffett said the number of people who had agreed to sign on was at the high end of his expectations. He said some people who declined to sign the pledge were planning to give away most of their wealth but did not want to draw attention to those plans.
Energy tycoon (大亨) Pickens, who is worth about $ 1 billion, said in his Giving Pledge letter: "I've long stated that I enjoy making money, and I enjoy giving it away. I'm not a big fan of inherited wealth. It generally does more harm than good."

The work for which Thomas Malthus is still most widely known is his Essay on the Principle of Population, which first appeared in 1798. This book introduced Malthus's __67__ that population inescapably outgrows subsistence (生活资料), and that this difference __68__ population size and the ability to adequately meet the __69__ subsistence needs of all the members of that population " naturally" produces a fundamental struggle for __70__ in which some flourish at the __71__ of others.
Charles Darwin's most important contribution __72__ the field of biology, described in his work. On the Origin of Species, was to __73__ Malthus's observation that plants and animals multiply faster than nature can provide for them to his own __74__ of the process of "evolution" - the notion that different forms of life develop __75__ from a common ancestry (祖先). Combining these elements, Darwin __76__ that the factors of "the struggle for existence" and "the survival of the fittest" are the central mechanisms __77__ which evolution is based. In this sense, then. Darwin introduced the possibility __78__ conflict and struggle are biological phenomena, which are __79__ central to human social existence.
A number of more contemporary social thinkers were __80__ by Darwin and continued this particular version of the conflict perspective, commonly referred to __81__ social Darwinism, into the twentieth century-Thus, for example, Herbert Spencer, a __82__ English social theorist, applied these ideas of the natural __83__ of conflict and survival of the fittest to his . notion of social evolution, __84__ William Graham Summer, an American sociologist, saw the __85__ for survival among individual actors as operating to bring about fundamental __86__ in the quality of human social life overall.

Surviving the Recession
America's recession began quietly at the end of 2007. Since then it has evolved into a global crisis. Reasonable people may disagree about whom to blame. Financiers who were not as clever as they thought they were? Regulators falling asleep at work? Consumers who borrowed too much? Politicians who thoughtlessly promoted home-ownership for those who could not afford it? All are guilty; and what a mess they have created.
Since 2007 America has shed 5 million jobs. More than 15% of the workforce are jobless or underemployed - roughly 25 million workers. The only industries swelling their payrolls are health care, utilities and the federal government. The value of listed shares in American firms collapsed by 57% from its peak in October 2007 to a low in March this year, though it has since bounced back somewhat. Industrial production fell by 12. 8% in the year to March, the worst slide since the Second World War. Mark Zandi, and economist at Moody's Economy, com, predicts that the recession will shrink America's economy by 3.5% in total. For most executives, this is the worst business environment they've ever seen.
Times are so tough that even bosses are taking pay cuts. Median (中位数的) pay for chief executives of S&P 500 companies fell 6.8% in 2008. The overthrown business giants of Wall Street took the biggest knock, with average pay cuts of 38% and median bonuses of zero. But there was some pain for everyone; median pay for chief executives of non-financial firms in the S&P 500 fell by 2.7%.
Nearly every business has a sad tale to tell. For example, Arne Sorenson, the president of Marriott hotels, likens the crisis to the downturn that hit his business after September 11th, 2001. When the twin towers fell, Americans stopped travelling. Marriott had its worst quarter ever, with revenues per room falling by 25%. This year, without a terrorist attack, the hotel industry is "putting the same numbers on the board", says Mr. Sorenson.
The hotel bust (不景气), like most busts, was preceded by a breathtaking boom. Although many other big firms resisted the temptation to over-borrow, developers borrowed heavily and built bigger and fancier hotels as if the whole world were planning a holiday in Las Vegas. When the bubble burst, demand collapsed. Hotel owners found themselves with a huge number of empty rooms even as a lot of unnecessary new hotels were ready to open.
Other industries have suffered even more. Large numbers of builders, property firms and retailers have gone bankrupt. And a disaster has hit Detroit. Last year the American car industry had the capacity to make 17 million vehicles. Sales in 2009 could be barely half of that. The Big Three American carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - accumulated ruinous costs over the post-war years, such as gold-plated health plans and pensions for workers who retired as young as 48. All three are desperately restructuring. Only Ford may survive in its current form.
Hard times breed hard feelings. Few Americans understand what caused the recession. Some are seeking scapegoats (替罪羊). Politicians are happy to take advantage. Bosses have been summoned to Washington to be scolded on live television. The president condemns their greed.

Extravagance (奢侈) is out
Businessfolk are bending over backwards to avoid seeming extravagant. Meetings at resorts are suddenly unacceptable. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, cancelled a conference in Las Vegas at the last minute and rebooked it in San Francisco, which cost more but sounded less fun.
Anyway, the pain will eventually end. American business will regain its shine. Many firms will die, but the survivors will emerge leaner and stronger than before. The financial sector's share of the economy will shrink, and stay shrunk for years to come. The importance of non-financial firms will accordingly rise, along with their ability to attract the best talent. America will remain the best place on earth to do business, so long as Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress resist the temptation to interfere too much, and so long as organised labour does not overplay its hand.
The crisis will prove hugely disruptive (破坏性的) , however. Bad management techniques will be exposed. Necessity will force the swift adoption of more efficient ones. At the same time, technological innovation (创新) will barely pause for breath- and two big political changes seem likely.
Mr. Obama's plan to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (排放), though necessary, will be far from cost-free, whatever his sunny speeches on the subject might suggest. The shift to a low-carbon economy will help some firms, hurt others and require every organisation that uses much energy to rethink how it operates. It is harder to predict how Mr. Obama's proposed reforms to the failing health-care system will turn out. If he succeeds in curbing costs - a big if - it would be a huge gain for America. Some businesses will benefit but the vast bulk of the savings will be captured by workers, not their employers.
In the next couple of years the businesses that thrive will be those that are tight with costs, careful of debt, cautious with cash flow and extremely attentive to what customers want. They will include plenty of names no one has yet heard of. 
Times change, and corporations change with them. In 1955 Time's Man of the Year was Harlow Curtice, the boss of GM. His firm was leading America towards " a new economic order" , the magazine wrote. Thanks to men like Curtice, "the bonds of scarcity" had been broken and America was rolling "to an all-time high of prosperity". Soon, Americans would need to spend "comparatively little time earning a living". 
Half a century later GM is a typical example of poor management. In March its chief executive was fired by Time's current Man of the Year, Mr Obama. The government now backs up the domestic car industry, lending it money and overseeing its turnaround plans. With luck, this will be short-lived. But there is a danger that Washington will end up micromanaging not only Detroit but also other parts of the economy. And clever as Mr Obama's advisers are, history suggests they will be bad at this.

Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage. 

Just when you had figured out how to manage fat in your diet, researchers are now warning against another common mealtime pitfall (陷阱) - salt.
A study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Standford University and Columbia University shows that even a __47__ decrease in daily salt intake (摄入) can lead to dramatic health benefits. The authors __48__ an annual drop of as many as 120 000 cases of heart disease, 66 000 __49__ of stroke and 99 000 heart attacks __50__ by high blood pressure after a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt.
The advantages, not surprisingly, were greater for African Americans, who are more likely to __51__ high blood pressure than other ethnic groups, and for the elderly, since blood vessels stiffen with age, which can lead to higher blood pressure.
"Everyone in the US is consuming salt far in __52__ of what is good for them," says lead author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo of UCSF. "What we are suggesting is that a population-wide effort to reduce salt intake, even __53__ will have health benefits."
The team conducted a computer-based analysis to determine the __54__ of a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt intake on rates of heart disease and death. They also calculated the cost savings emerging from the amount of disease that would be __55__ because of lower blood pressure. The conclusion: by cutting salt intake nationwide, the US could save $10 billion to $24 billion __56__ in health care costs.

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 

The Gatais used to frown when they received power bills that routinely topped $200. Last September the couple moved into a 1 500-square-foot home in Premier Gardens, a subdivision of 95 "zero-energy homes" (ZEH) just outside town. Now they're actually eager to see their electricity bills. The grand total over the 10 months they've lived in the three-bedroom house: $75. For the past two months they haven't paid a cent.
ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create houses that produce as much energy as they consume. Premier Gardens is one of a half-dozen subdivisions in California where every home cuts power consumption by 50%, mostly by using low-power appliances and solar panels. 
Aside from the panels on the roof, Premier Gardens looks like a community of conventional homes. But inside, special windows cut power bills by blocking solar heat in summer and retaining indoor warmth in winter.
The rest of the energy savings comes from the solar units. They don't just feed the home they serve. If they generate more power than the home is using, the excess flows into the utility's power grid (电网). The residents are billed by "net metering": they pay for the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the kilowatts (千瓦) they feed into it. If a home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero.
That sounds like a bad deal for the power company, but it's not. Solar homes produce the most power on the hot sunny afternoons when everyone rushes home to turn up the air conditioner. "It helps us lower usage at peak power times," says solar expert Mike Keesee. "That lets us avoid building costly plants or buying expensive power at peak usage time."
What's not to like? Mostly the costs. The special features can add $25000 or more to the purchase price of a house. Tax breaks bring the cost down, especially in California, but in many states ZEHs can be prohibitively expensive. For the consumer, it's a matter of paying now for the hardware to save later on the utilities.

Passage Two 
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. 

Romantic love has clear evolutionary roots but our views about what makes an ideal romantic relationship can be swayed by the society we live in. So says psychologist Maureen O'Sullivan from the University of San Francisco. She suggests that humans have always tried to strengthen the pair-bond to maximise (使最大化) reproductive success.
Many societies throughout history and around the world today have cultivated strong pressures to stay married. In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be promoted by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between two families, not just two individuals. In modern western societies, however, the focus on individuality and independence means that people are less concerned about conforming to (遵守) the dictates of family and culture. In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds, O'Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long. "That's why historically we see an increase in romantic love as a basis for forming long-term relationships," she says.
According to O'Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have, and actually do experience, when in love. Although the negative emotions associated with romantic love-fear of loss, disappointment and jealousy-are fairly consistent across cultures, the positive feelings can vary. "If you ask Japanese students to list the positive attributes they expect in a romantic partner, they rate highly things like loyalty, commitment and devotion," says O'Sullivan. "If you ask American college women, they expect everything under the suit: in addition to being committed, partners have to be amusing, funny and a friend."
We judge a potential partner according to our specific cultural expectations about what romantic love should feel like. If you believe that you have found true romance, and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on, there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together. O'Sullivan argues.

Is College a Worthy Investment?
A) Why are we spending so much money on college? And why are we so unhappy about it? We all seem to agree that a college education is wonderful, and yet strangely we worry when we see families investing so much in this supposedly essential good. Maybe it's time to ask a question that seems almost sacrilegious (大不敬的): is all this investment in college education really worth it?
B) The answer, I fear, is no. For an increasing number of kids, the extra time and money spent pursuing a college diploma will leave them worse off than they were before they set foot on campus.
C) For my entire adult life, a good education has been the most important thing for middle-class households. My parents spent more educating my sister and me than they spent on their house, and they're not the only ones... and, of course, for an increasing number of families, most of the cost of their house is actually the cost of living in a good school district. Questioning the value of a college education seems a bit like questioning the value of happiness, or fun.
D) The average price of all goods and services has risen about 50 percent. But the price of a college education has nearly doubled in that time. Is the education that today's students are getting twice as good? Are new workers twice as smart? Have they become somehow massively more expensive to educate?
E) Perhaps a bit. Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economics professor, says, "I look at the data, and I see college costs rising faster than inflation up to the mid-1980s by 1 percent a year. Now I see them rising 3 to 4 percent a year over inflation. What has happened? The federal government has started dropping money out of airplanes. " Aid has increased, subsidized(补贴的) loans have become available, and "the universities have gotten the money." Economist Bryan Caplan, who is writing a book about education, agrees: "It's a giant waste of resources that will continue as long as the subsidies continue."
F) Promotional literature for colleges and student loans often speaks of debt as an "investment in yourself." But an investment is supposed to generate income to pay off the loans. More than half of all recent graduates are unemployed or in jobs that do not require a degree, and the amount of student-loan debt carried by households has increased more than five times since 1999. These graduates were told that a diploma was all they needed to succeed, but it won't even get them out of the spare bedroom at Mom and Dad's. For many, the most visible result of their four years is the loan payments, which now average hundreds of dollars a month on loan balances in the tens of thousands.
G) It's true about the money-sort of. College graduates now make 80 percent more than people who have only a high-school diploma, and though there are no precise estimates, the wage premium (高出的部分) for an outstanding school seems to be even higher. But that's not true of every student. It's very easy to spend four years majoring in English literature and come out no more employable than you were before you went in. Conversely, chemical engineers straight out of school can easily make almost four times the wages of an entry-level high-school graduate.
H) James Heckman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has examined how the returns on education break down for individuals with different backgrounds and levels of ability. "Even with these high prices, you're still finding a high return for individuals who are bright and motivated," he says. On the other hand, "if you're not college ready, then the answer is no, it's not worth it." Experts tend to agree that for the average student, college is still worth it today, but they also agree that the rapid increase in price is eating up more and more of the potential return. For borderline students, tuition(学费) rise can push those returns into negative territory.
I) Everyone seems to agree that the government, and parents, should be rethinking how we invest in higher education and that employers need to rethink the increasing use of college degrees as crude screening tools for jobs that don't really require college skills. "Employers seeing a surplus of college graduates and looking to fill jobs are just adding that requirement." says Vedder. "In fact, a college degree becomes a job requirement for becoming a bar-tender."
J) We have started to see some change on the finance side. A law passed in 2007 allows many students to cap their loan payment at 10 percent of their income and forgives any balance after 25 years. But of course, that doesn't control the cost of education! it just shifts it to taxpayers. It also encourages graduates to choose lower-paying careers, which reduces the financial return to education still further. "You're subsidizing people to become priests and poets and so forth," says Heckman. "You may think that's a good thing, or you may not." Either way it will be expensive for the government.
K) What might be a lot cheaper is putting more kids to work. Caplan notes that work also builds valuable skills- probably more valuable for kids who don't naturally love sitting in a classroom. Heckman agrees wholeheartedly: "People are different, and those abilities can be shaped. That's what we've learned, and public policy should recognize that."
L) Heckman would like to see more apprenticeship-style(学徒式) programs, where kids can learn in the workplace-learn not just specific job skills, but the kind of "soft skills," like getting to work on time and getting along with a team- that are crucial for career success. "It's about having mentors(指导者) and having workplace-based education," he says. "Time and again I've seen examples of this kind of program working."
M) Ah, but how do we get there from here? With better public policy, hopefully, but also by making better individual decisions. "Historically markets have been able to handle these things," says Vedder. "and I think eventually markets will handle this one. If it doesn't improve soon, people are going to wake up and ask, 'Why am I going to college?'"

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

A recent global survey of 2000 high-net-worth individuals found that 60% were not planning on a traditional retirement. Among US participants, 75% expected to continue working in some capacity even after stepping away from full-time jobs. "Many of these people made their wealth by doing something they're passionate (有激情的) about." says Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for Barclays Wealth Americas. "Given the choice, they prefer to continue working." Barclays calls these people "nevertirees."
Unlike many Americans compelled into early retirement by company restrictions, the average nevertiree often has no one forcing his hand. If 106-year-old investor Irving Kahn, head of his own family firm, wants to keep coming to work every day. who's going to stop him? Seventy-eight-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's job security is guaranteed in the Constitution.
It may seem that these elderly people are trying to cheat death. In fact, they are. And it's working. Howard Friedman, a professor at UC Riverside, found in his research that those who work hardest and are successful in their careers often live the longest lives. "People are generally being given bad advice to slow down, take it easy, stop worrying, and retire to Florida," he says. He described one study participant, still working at the age of 100, who was recently disappointed to see his son retire.
"We're beginning to see a change in how people view retirement," says George Leeson, co-director of the Institute of Population Ageing at Oxford. Where once retirement was seen as a brief reward after a long struggle through some miserable job, it is now akin (近似) to being cast aside. What Leeson terms "the Warren Buffett effect" is becoming more broadly appealing as individuals come to "view retirement as not simply being linked to economic productivity but also about contribution."
Observers are split on whether this is a wholly good thing. On the one hand, companies and financial firms can benefit from the wisdom of a resilient(坚韧的) chief. On the other, the new generation can find it more difficult to advance-an argument that typically holds little sway to a nevertiree.

56. What do we learn about the so-called "nevertirees"?
A) They are passionate about making a fortune.
B) They have no choice but to continue working.
C) They love what they do and choose not to retire.
D) They will not retire unless they are compelled to.

57. What do Irving Kahn and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have in common?
A) Neither of them is subject to forced retirement.
B) Neither of them desires reward for their work.
C) Both cling to their positions despite opposition.
D) Both are capable of coping with heavy workloads.

58. What is the finding of Howard Friedman's research?
A) The harder you work, the bigger your fortune will be.
B) The earlier you retire, the healthier you will be.
C) Elderly people have to slow down to live longer.
D) Working at an advanced age lengthens people's life.

59. What is the traditional view of retirement according to the passage?
A) It means a burden to the younger generation.
B) It is a symbol of a mature and civilized society.
C) It is a compensation for one's life-long hard work.
D) It helps increase a nation's economic productivity.

60. What do critics say about "nevertirees"?
A) They are an obstacle to a company's development.
B) They lack the creativity of the younger generation.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

When we talk about Americans barely into adulthood who are saddled with unbearable levels of debt, the conversation is almost always about student loan debt. But there's a growing body of evidence suggesting that today's young adults are also drowning in credit-card debt and that many of them will take this debt to their graves.
More than 20% overspent their income by more than $100 every single month. Since they haven't built up their credit histories yet, it's a safe bet that these young adults are paying relatively high interest rates on the resulting credit card debt.
Although many young people blame "socializing" as a barrier to saving money, most of them aren't knocking back $20 drinks in trendy (时尚的) lounges. They're struggling with much more daily financial demands.
To a disturbingly large extent, the young and the broke are relying on credit cards to make it until their next payday. This obviously isn't sustainable in the long run. and it's going to put a huge drag on their spending power even after they reach their peak earning years, because they'll still be paying interest on that bottle of orange juice or box of spaghetti (意式面条) they bought a decade earlier.
A new study out of Ohio State University found that young adults are accumulating credit card debt at a more rapid rate than other age groups, and that they're slower at paying it off. "If what we found continues to hold true, we may have more elderly people with substantial financial problems in the future," warns Lucia Dunn, professor of economics at Ohio State. "If our findings persist, we may be faced with a financial crisis among elderly people who can't pay off their credit cards."
Dunn says a lot of these young people are never going to get out from under their credit card debt. "Many people are borrowing on credit cards so heavily that payoff rates at these levels are not sufficient to recover their credit card debt by the end of their life, which could have loss implications for the credit card issuing banks."

On the Overuse of the Mobile Phone
As is shown in the picture, having a mobile phone in hand and at the ready is the default mode while walking on the streets. What this cartoon symbolically reveals is that people nowadays, especially young people, are growing increasingly dependent on their mobile phones.
It is true that the mobile phone has brought great convenience to people's life. 1. However, just as is illustrated in the picture, the overuse of it may lead to several bad consequences. Io begin with, there is evidence that long-term exposure to electromagnetic radiation may trigger many health problems, such as insomnia, headaches and even cancers. 2. In addition, when people immerse themselves in the mobile phone, they tend to pay less attention to their surroundings, posing an immediate threat to their life, health and property. Last but not least, excessive use of mobile phones means much less chance of face-to-face interactions with the people who populate their real lives. 
In conclusion, while mobile phones have contributed a lot to making our life more convenient, we should use them appropriately and rationally.

The Chinese knot, originally invented by the craftsmen, has become an elegant and colorful art and craft over hundreds of years' improvement. In ancient times, it was used to record events, but nowadays it is mainly functioning as decorations. " Knot" signifies love, marriage and reunion in Chinese. Often used as gift exchanges or decorations, the Chinese knot is believed to bring good luck as well as ward off evil spirits. The handicraft has been passed down from one generation to another and now is gaining popularity both at home and abroad.

You probably have noticed that people express similar ideas in different ways, depending on the situation they are in. This is very __26__. All languages have two general levels of usage: a formal level and an informal level. English is no __27__. The difference in these two levels is the situation in which you use a __28__ level. Formal language is the kind of language you find in textbooks, __29__, and in business letters. You would also use formal English in compositions and __30__ that you write in school. Informal language is used in conversation with colleagues, family members and friends, and when we write __31__ notes or letters to close friends.
Formal language is different from informal language __32__. First, formal language tends to be more polite. What we may find interesting is that it usually takes more words to be polite. For example, I might say to a friend or a family member. "Close the door, please." but to a __33__, I probably would say, "Would you mind closing the door?"
Another difference between formal and informal language is some of the __34__. There are bound to be some words and phrases that __35__ formal language and others that are informal. Let's say that I really like soccer. If I'm talking to my friend, I might say "I'm just crazy about soccer!" But if I were talking to my boss, I would probably say "I really enjoy soccer."

A Mess on the Ladder of Success
A) Throughout American history there has almost always been at least one central economic narrative that gave the ambitious or unsatisfied reason to pack up and seek their fortune elsewhere. For the first 300 or so years of European settlement, the story was about moving outward: getting immigrants to the continent and then to the frontier to clear the prairies(大草原), drain the wetlands and build new cities.
B) By the end of the 19th century, as the frontier vanished, the US had a mild panic attack. What would this energetic, enterprising country be without new lands to conquer? Some people, such as Teddy Roosevelt, decided to keep on conquering (Cuba, the Philippines, etc.), but eventually, in industrialization, the US found a new narrative of economic mobility at home. From the 1890s to the 1960s, people moved from farm to city, first in the North and then in the South. In fact, by the 1950s, there was enough prosperity and white-collar work that many began to move to the suburbs. As the population aged, there was also a shift from the cold Rust Belt to the comforts of the Sun Belt. We think of this as an old person's migration, but it created many jobs for the young in construction and health care, not to mention tourism, retail and restaurants.
C) For the last 20 years from the end of the cold war through two burst bubbles in a single decade-the US has been casting about for its next economic narrative. And now it is experiencing another period of panic, which is bad news for much of the workforce but particularly for its youngest members.
D) The US has always been a remarkably mobile country, but new data from the Census Bureau indicate that mobility has reached its lowest level in recorded history. Sure, some people are stuck in homes valued at less than their mortgages(抵押贷款), but many young people-who don't own homes and don't yet have families-are staying put, too. This suggests, among other things, that people aren't packing up for new economic opportunities the way they used to. Rather than dividing the country into the 1 percenters versus(与......相对) everyone else, the split in our economy is really between two other classes: the mobile and immobile.
E) Part of the problem is that the country's largest industries are in decline. In the past, it was perfectly clear where young people should go for work (Chicago in the 1870s, Detroit in the 1910s, Houston in the 1970s) and, more or less, what they'd be doing when they got there (killing cattle, building cars, selling oil). And these industries were large enough to offer jobs to each class of worker, from unskilled laborer to manager or engineer. Today, the few bright spots in our economy are relatively small (though some promise future growth) and decentralized. There are great jobs in Silicon Valley, in the biotech research capitals of Boston and Raleigh-Durham and in advanced manufacturing plants along the southern z-85 corridor. These companies recruit all over the country and the globe for workers with specific abilities. (You don't need to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook. to get a job in one of the microhubs(微中心), by the way. But you will almost certainly need at least a B. A. in computer science or a year or two at a technical school.) This newer, select job market is national, and it offers members of the mobile class competitive salaries and higher bargaining power.
F) Many members of the immobile class, on the other hand, live in the America of the gloomy headlines. If you have no specialized skills, there's little reason to uproot to another state and be the last in line for a low-paying job at a new auto plant or a green-energy startup. The surprise in the census(普查) data, however, is that the immobile workforce is not limited to unskilled workers. In fact, many have a college degree.
G) Until now, a B. A. in any subject was a near-guarantee of at least middle-class wages. But today, a quarter of college graduates make less than the typical worker without a bachelor's degree. David Autor, a prominent labor economist at M.I.T., recently told me that a college degree alone is no longer a guarantor of a good job. While graduates from top universities are still likely to get a good job no matter what their major is, he said, graduates from less-famous schools are going to be judged on what they know. To compete for jobs on a national level, they should be armed with the skills that emerging industries need, whether technical or not.
H) Those without such specialized skills-like poetry, or even history, majors-are already competing with their neighbors for the same sorts of second-rate, poorer-paying local jobs like low-level management or big-box retail sales. And with the low-skilled labor market atomized into thousands of microeconomics, immobile workers are less able to demand better wages or conditions or to acquire valuable skills.
I) So what, exactly, should the ambitious young worker of today be learning? Unfortunately, it's hard to say, since the US doesn't have one clear national project. There are plenty of emerging, smaller industries, but which ones are the most promising? (Nanotechnology's(纳米技术) moment of remarkable growth seems to have been 5 years into the future for something like 20 years now.) It's not clear exactly what skills are most needed or if they will even be valuable in a decade.
J) What is clear is that all sorts of government issues--education. health-insurance portability, worker retraining-are no longer just bonuses to already prosperous lives but existential requirements. It's in all of our interests to make sure that as many people as possible are able to move toward opportunity, and America's ability to invest people and money in exciting new ideas is still greater than that of most other wealthy countries. (As recently as five years ago, US migration was twice the rate of European Union states.) That, at least, is some comfort at a time when our national economy seems to be searching for its next story line.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

A new study shows a large gender gap on economic policy among the nation's professional economists, a divide similar to the gender divide found in the general public.
"As a group, we are pro-market." says Ann Mari May. co-author of the study and a University of Nebraska economist. "But women are more likely to accept government regulation and involvement in economic activity than our male colleagues."
"It's very puzzling," says free market economist Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. "Not a day goes by that I don't ask myself why there are so few women economists on the free market side."
A native of France, de Rugy supported government intervention(干预) early in her life but changed her mind after studying economics. "We want many of the same things as liberals-less poverty, more health care-but have radically different ideas on how to achieve it."
Liberal economist Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research, says male economists have been on the inside of the profession, confirming each other's anti-regulation views. Women, as outsiders, "are more likely to think independently or at least see people outside of the economics profession as forming their peer group," he says.
The gender balance in economics is changing. One-third of economics doctorates (博士学位) now go to women. "More diversity is needed at the table when public policy is discussed," May says.
Economists do agree on some things. Female economists agree with men that Europe has too much regulation and that Wal-mart is good for society. Male economists agree with their female colleagues that military spending is too high.
The genders are most divorced from each other on the question of equality for women. Male economists overwhelmingly think the wage gap between men and women is largely the result of individuals' skills, experience and voluntary choices. Female economists overwhelmingly disagree by a margin of 4-to-1.
The biggest disagreement: 76% of women say faculty opportunities in economics favor men. Male economists point the opposite way: 80% say women are favored or the process is neutral.

56. What is the finding of the new study?
A) The gender divide is a big concern of the general public.
B) Men and women understand economics quite differently.
C) The gap between male and female economists needs to be closed.
D) Male and female economists disagree widely on economic policy.

57. What does Ann Mari May say about female economists?
A) They are strongly against male domination in the economics profession.
B) They tend to support government intervention in economic activity.
C) They usually play an active role in public policy-making.
D) They are mostly strong advocates of free market economy.

58. What do we learn about economist Veronique de Rugy?
A) She represents most female economists' standpoint.
B) She devotes herself to eliminating women's poverty.
C) Her study of economics changed her view on government's role in economic activities.
D) Her academic background helped her get into the inner circle of the economics profession.

59. What does Ann Mari May imply about public policy-making?
A) More female economists should get involved.
B) It should do justice to female economists' studies.
C) More attention should be paid to women's rights.
D) It should aim at sustainable development.

60. On what issue do male and female economists differ most?
A) Government regulation.
B) Job creation.
C) Military spending.
D) Gender equality.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

The number of postgraduate students travelling from non-EU countries to study at UK universities has fallen for the first time in 16 years, fuelling fears that the government's immigration crackdown is discouraging thousands of the brightest students from continuing their studies in Britain.
Jo Beall, British Council director of education and society, said the fall would cause alarm among UK vice-chancellors(大学行政主管). "The sector was expecting a decline in growth, but the actual reduction in postgraduate numbers is of real concern as international students make up the majority of numbers in many postgraduate courses and research teams in science, technology, engineering and mathematics."
"Attracting the brightest and most ambitious postgraduate and research students is critical if the UK is to maintain its quality reputation for research," Beall said.
Universities get a third of their tuition(学费) fee revenue from non-EU students. There is growing fear among vice-chancellors that this revenue-as well as the cultural, academic and economic benefit international students bring-is being put at risk.
Tim Westlake, director for the student experience at Manchester University, said students whose families relied on them working in the UK after their studies to gain experience and repay the fees were starting to look elsewhere.
Last month the home secretary. Theresa May. announced that embassy staff would interview more than 100 000 applicants in an attempt to prevent bogus(假冒的) ones entering the country. She also said immigrants were responsible for pushing up UK house prices. The comments followed the introduction of new limitations on students' right to work during and after their studies.
Beall said: "Government statistics for the first time provide real evidence that the changes to UK visa regulations may have discouraged many students from applying to the UK. and in particular postgraduate students who are so important to the UK's research output. The UK enjoys an excellent reputation around the world for the high quality of our education system, so the government needs to ensure that institutions have all the support they need to attract international students who make a tremendous academic, cultural and economic contribution to the UK."

Electronic Communication Cannot Replace Face-to-Face Contact
The picture above is a vivid description of a phenomenon that communication between teenagers and their parents is usually through the Internet. Although the Internet has changed the ways of communication, I do not think that elect ionic communication can replace face-to-face contact.
1. Firstly, face-to-face contact is much better than electronic communication in terms of enhancing parent-child relationship, for the former can better guarantee honesty of the communication. Secondly, face-to-face contact can make people concentrate on what they are talking about. So people can think about the problems seriously. Last but not least, face-to-face contact can eliminate distrust between parents and children because both sides will not be suspicious about other's intentions if they can talk with each other in such a direct way.
2. To sum up, the Internet has greatly influenced the ways of communication, but it can never replace face-to-face contact.

This is what diners often have been asked, "Would you like tea or coffee?" Many Westerners favour coffee while the Chinese tend to choose tea. Tradition has it that an ancient Chinese emperor discovered the tea five thousand years ago and used it to treat illnesses. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, teahouses spread all over China. Tea drinking was introduced to Japan in the 6th century while it was not introduced into Europe or America until the 17th and 18th centuries. Nowadays, tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is not only a kind of Chinese national drink, but also an important part of Chinese tradition and culture.

The rise of the sharing economy

A) Last night 40 000 people rented accommodation from a service that offers 250 000 rooms in 30 000 cities in 192 countries. They chose their rooms and paid for everything online. But their beds were provided by private individuals, rather than a hotel chain. Hosts and guests were matched up by Airbnb, a firm based in San Francisco. Since its launch in 2008 more than 4 million people have used it 2.5 million of them in 2012 alone. It is the most prominent example of a huge new "sharing economy", in which people rent beds, cars, boats and other assets directly from each other, co-ordinated via the internet.
B) You might think this is no different from running a bed-and-breakfast (家庭旅店), owning a timeshare (分时度假房) or participating in a car pool. But technology has reduced transaction costs, making sharing assets cheaper and easier than ever-and therefore possible on a much larger scale. The big change is the availability of more data about people and things, which allows physical assets to be divided and consumed as services. Before the internet, renting a surfboard, a power tool or a parking space from someone else was feasible, but was usually more trouble than it was worth. Now websites such as Airbnb, Relay Rides and SnapGoods match up owners and renters; smartphones with GPS let people sec where the nearest rentable car is parked; social networks provide a way to check up on people and build trust; and online payment systems handle the billing.
What's mine is yours, for a fee
C) Just as peer-to-peer businesses like eBay allow anyone to become a retailer, sharing sites let individuals act as an ad hoc (临时的) taxi service, car-hire firm or boutique hotel (精品酒店) as and when it suits them. Just go online or download an app. The model works for items that are expensive to buy and are widely owned by people who do not make full use of them. Bedrooms and cars are the most obvious examples, but you can also rent camping spaces in Sweden, fields in Australia and washing machines in France. As advocates of the sharing economy like to put it, access trumps (胜过) ownership.
D) Rachel Botsman, the author of a book on the subject, says the consumer peer-to-peer rental market alone is worth $26 billion. Broader definitions of the sharing economy include peer-to-peer lending or putting a solar panel on your roof and selling power back to the grid (电网). And it is not just individuals: the web makes it easier for companies to rent out spare offices and idle machines, too. But the core of the sharing economy is people renting things from each other.
E) Such "collaborative (合作的) consumption" is a good thing for several reasons. Owners make money from underused assets. Airbnb says hosts in San Francisco who rent out their homes do so for an average of 58 nights a year, making $9300. Car owners who rent their vehicles to others using RelayRides make an average of $250 a month; some make more than $1000. Renters, meanwhile, pay less than they would if they bought the item themselves, or turned to a traditional provider such as a hotel or car-hire firm. And there are environmental benefits, too: renting a car when you need it, rather than owning one, means fewer cars are required and fewer resources must be devoted to making them.
F) For sociable souls, meeting new people by staying in their homes is part of the charm. Curmudgeons (倔脾气的人) who imagine that every renter is a murderer can still stay at conventional hotels. For others, the web fosters trust. As well as the background checks carried out by platform owners, online reviews and ratings are usually posted by both parties to each transaction, which makes it easy to spot bad drivers, bathrobe-thieves and surfboard-wreckers. By using Facebook and other social networks, participants can check each other out and identify friends (or friends of friends) in common. An Airbnb user had her apartment trashed in 2011. But the remarkable thing is how well the system usually works.
Peering into the future
G) The sharing economy is a little like online shopping, which started in America 15 years ago. At first, people were worried about security. But having made a successful purchase from, say, Amazon, they felt safe buying elsewhere. Similarly, using Airbnb or a car-hire service for the first time encourages people to try other offerings. Next, consider eBay. Having started out as a peer-to-peer marketplace, it is now dominated by professional "power sellers" (many of whom started out as ordinary eBay users). The same may happen with the sharing economy, which also provides new opportunities for enterprise. Some people have bought cars solely to rent them out, for example.
H) Existing rental businesses are getting involved too. Avis, a car-hire firm, has a share in a sharing rival. So do GM and Daimler, two carmakers. In future, companies may develop hybrid (混合的) models, listing excess capacity (whether vehicles, equipment or office space) on peer-to-peer rental sites. In the past, new ways of doing things online have not displaced the old ways entirely. But they have often changed them. Just as internet shopping forced Wal-mart and Tesco to adapt, so online sharing will shake up transport, tourism, equipment-hire and more.
I) The main worry is regulatory uncertainty. Will room-renters be subject to hotel taxes, for example? In Amsterdam officials are using Airbnb listings to track down unlicensed hotels. In some American cities, peer-to-peer taxi services have been banned after lobbying by traditional taxi firms. The danger is that although some rules need to be updated to protect consumers from harm, existing rental businesses will try to destroy competition. People who rent out rooms should pay tax, of course, but they should not be regulated like a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The lighter rules that typically govern bed-and-breakfasts are more than adequate.
J) The sharing economy is the latest example of the internet's value to consumers. This emerging model is now big and disruptive (颠覆性的) enough for regulators and companies to have woken up to it. That is a sign of its immense potential. It is time to start caring about sharing.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.
Studies have shown, for instance, that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues, like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.
A new study suggested that our short-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them-in other words, how much they remembered eating.
This disparity(差异) suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal, says Jeffrey M. Brunstrom, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.
"Hunger isn't controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal," Brunstrom says. "This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought."
These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie(卡路里) milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones(荷尔蒙), depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 or 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.
What does this mean for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves into eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food and avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.
The so-called mindful-eating strategies can fight distractions and help us control our appetite, Brunstrom says.

56. What is said to be a factor affecting our appetite and food intake?
A) How we perceive the food we eat. 
B) What ingredients the food contains. 
C) When we eat our meals.
D) How fast we eat our meals.

57. What would happen at meal time if you remembered eating a lot in the previous meal?
A) You would probably be more picky about food.
B) You would not feel like eating the same food.
C) You would have a good appetite.
D) You would not feel so hungry.

58. What do we learn from the 2011 study?
A) Food labels may mislead consumers in their purchases.
B) Food labels may influence our body's response to food.
C) Hunger levels depend on one's consumption of calories.
D) People tend to take in a lot more calories than necessary.

59. What does Brunstrom suggest we do to control our appetite?
A) Trick ourselves into eating less. 
B) Choose food with fewer calories. 
C) Concentrate on food while eating.
D) Pick dishes of the right size.

60. What is the main idea of the passage?
A) Eating distractions often affect our food digestion.
B) Psychological factors influence our hunger levels.
C) Our food intake is determined by our biological needs.
D) Good eating habits will contribute to our health.


Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

As a society we might want to rethink the time and money spent on education, so that these resources can benefit a greater percentage of the population. Ideally, both high schools and colleges can prepare individuals for the ever-changing roles that are likely to be expected of them.
High school degrees offer far less in the way of preparation for work than they might, or than many other nations currently offer, creating a growing skills gap in our economy. We encourage students to go on to college whether they are prepared or not. or have a clear sense of purpose or interest, and now have the highest college dropout rate in the world.
We might look to other countries for models of how high schools can offer better training, as well as the development of a work ethic (勤奋工作的美德) and the intellectual skills needed for continued learning and development. 1 recommend Harvard's 2011 "Pathways to Prosperity" report for more attention to the "forgotten half" (those who do not go on to college) and ideas about how to address this issue.
Simultaneously, the liberal arts become more important than ever. In a knowledge economy where professional roles change rapidly and many college students are preparing for positions that may not even exist yet, the skill set needed is one that prepares them for change and continued learning.
Learning to express ideas well in both writing and speech, knowing how to find information, and knowing how to do research are all solid background skills for a wide variety of roles, and such training is more important than any particular major in a liberal arts college. We need to continue to value broad preparation in thinking skills that will serve for a lifetime.
Students also need to learn to work independently and to make responsible decisions. The lengthening path to adulthood appears exacerbated(恶化) by parental involvement in the college years. Given the rising investment in college education, parental concern is not surprising, but learning where and when to intervene(干预) will help students take more ownership of the outcomes of these increasingly costly educations.

【作文范文】
The Impact of the Internet on Learning
The Internet has exerted great influence on learning, 1. so that an increasing number of individuals value it as a truth that obtaining information is equal to education. However, as the picture warns us, education involves more than simply learning to obtain information.
From my perspective, education also includes a ideal thinking and practical skills rather than a mere accumulation of information and knowledge. For one thing, critical thinking is essential to scientific progress, contributing to innovation and technical advances, just as Confucius warned us, "Learning without thinking leads to confusion." For another, 2. it is crucial to apply what you have learned to practice and that's the very reason why exceptional scientists accomplish great achievements in their fields.
In a word, the Internet does provide valuable information for learners, but people should be fully aware of the essence of education and attach importance to cultivating their character and developing their ability instead of just giving priority to dependence on the Internet. Thus, only by emphasizing innovation can education be completely fulfilled in practice.

The next; step is for the suspect to go before a judge. The judge decides whether the suspect should be kept in jail or __29__. If the suspect has no previous criminal record and the judge feels that he will return to court __30__ run away, he can go free. Otherwise, the suspect must put up bail (保释金). At this time, too, the judge will __31__ a court lawyer to defend the suspect if he can't afford one.
The suspect returns to court a week or two later. A lawyer from the district, attorney's office presents a case against the suspect. The attorney may present __32__ as well as witnesses. The judge then decides whether there is enough reason to __33__.

Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehension  (40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks.You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage.Read the passage through carefully before making your choices.Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter.Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.You may not use any ,of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage. 
Global warming is a trend toward warmer conditions around the world. Part of the warming is natural; we have experienced a 20,000-year-long warming as the last ice age ended and the ice __36__ away. However, we have already reached temperatures that are in __37__ with other minimum-ice periods, so continued warming is likely not natural. We are __38__ to a predicted worldwide increase in temperatures __39__ between and 6*C over the next, 100 years. The warming will be more __40__ in some areas, less in others, and some places may even cool off. Likewise, the __41__ of this warming will be very different depending on where you are-coastal areas must worry about rising sea levels, while Siberia and northern Canada may become more habitable (宜居的) and __42__ for humans than these areas are now. 
The fact remains, however, that it will likely get warmer, on __43__ , everywhere. Scientists are in general agreement that the warmer conditions we have been experiencing are at least in part the result of a human-induced global warming trend. Some scientists __44__ that the changes we are seeing fall within the range of random (无规律的) variation-some years are cold, others warm, and we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years __45__ -but that is becoming an increasingly rare interpretation in the face of continued and increasing warm conditions.

The End of the Book?
A) Amazon, by far the largest bookseller in the country, reported on May 19 that it is now selling more books in its electronic Kindle format than in the old paper-and-ink format. That is remarkable, considering that the Kindle has only been around for four years. E-books now account for 14 percent of all book sales in this country and are increasing far faster than overall book sales. E-book sales are up 146 percent over last year, while hardback sales increased 6 percent and paperbacks decreased 8 percent.
B) Does this spell the doom of the physical book? Certainly not immediately, and perhaps not at all. What it does mean is that the book business will go through a transformation in the next decade or so more profound than any it has seen since Gutenberg introduced printing from moveable type in the 1450s.
C) Physical books will surely become much rarer in the marketplace. Mass market paperbacks, which have been declining for years anyway, will probably disappear, as will hardbacks for mysteries, thrillers, "romance fiction," etc. Such books, which only rarely end up in permanent collections, either private or public, will probably only be available as e-books within a few years. Hardback and trade paperbacks for "serious" nonfiction and fiction will surely last longer. Perhaps it will become the mark of an author to reckon with that he or she is still published in hard copy.
D) As for children's books, who knows? Children's books are like dog food in that the purchasers are not the consumers, so the market (and the marketing) is inherently strange.
E) For clues to the book's future, let's look at some examples of technological change and see what happened to the old technology.
F) One technology replaces another only because the new technology is better, cheaper, or both. The greater the difference, the sooner and more thoroughly the new technology replaces the old. Printing with moveable type on paper dramatically reduced the cost of producing a book compared with the old-fashioned ones handwritten on vellum, which comes from sheepskin. A Bible-to be sure, a long book-required vellum made from 300 sheepskins and countless man-hours of labor. Before printing arrived, a Bible cost more than a middle-class house. There were perhaps 50,000 books in all of Europe in 1450. By 1500 there were 10 million.
G) But while printing quickly caused the handwritten book to die out, handwriting lingered on (继续存在) well into the 16th century. Very special books are still occasionally produced on vellum, but they are one-of-a-kind show pieces.
H) Sometimes a new technology doesn't drive the old one out, but only parts of it while forcing the rest to evolve. The movies were widely predicted to drive live theater out of the marketplace, but they didn't, because theater turned out to have qualities movies could not reproduce. Equally, TV was supposed to replace movies but, again, did not.
I) Movies did, however, fatally impact some parts of live theater. And while TV didn't kill movies, it did kill second-rate pictures, shorts, and cartoons.
J) Nor did TV kill radio. Comedy and drama shows ("Jack Benny," "Amos and Andy," "The Shadow") all migrated to television. But because you can't drive a car and watch television at the same time, rush hour became radio's prime time, while music, talk, and news radio greatly enlarged their audiences. Radio is today a very different business than in the late 1940s and a much larger one.
K) Sometimes old technology lingers for centuries because of its symbolic power. Mounted cavalry (骑兵) replaced the chariot (二轮战车) on the battlefield around 1000 BC. But chariots maintained their place in parades and triumphs right up until the end of the Roman Empire 1,500 years later. The sword hasn't had a military function for a hundred years, but is still part of an officer's full- dress uniform, precisely because a sword always symbolized "an officer and a gentleman. "
L) Sometimes new technology is a little cranky (不稳定的) at first. Television repairman was a common occupation in the 1950s, for instance. And so the old technology remains as a backup. Steamships captured the North Atlantic passenger business from sail in the 1840s because of its much greater speed. But steamships didn't lose their sails until the 1880s, because early marine engines had a nasty habit of breaking down. Until ships became large enough (and engines small enough) to mount two engines side by side, they needed to keep sails. (The high cost of steam and the lesser need for speed kept the majority of the world's ocean freight moving by sail until the early years of the 20th century.)
M) Then there is the fireplace. Central heating was present in every upper- and middle-class home by the second half of the 19th century. But functioning fireplaces remain to this day a powerful selling point in a house or apartment. I suspect the reason is a deep-rooted love of lire. Fire was one of the earliest major technological advances for humankind, providing heat, protection, and cooked food (which is much easier to eat and digest). Human control of fire goes back far enough (over a million years) that evolution could have produced a genetic leaning towards fire as a central aspect of human life.
N) Books-especially books the average person could afford-haven't been around long enough to produce evolutionary change in humans. But they have a powerful hold on many people nonetheless, a hold extending far beyond their literary content. At their best, they are works of art and there is a tactile (触觉的) pleasure in books necessarily lost in e-book versions. The ability to quickly thumb through pages is also lost. And a room with books in it induces, at least in some, a feeling not dissimilar to that of a fire in the fireplace on a cold winter's night.
O) For these reasons I think physical books will have a longer existence as a commercial product than some currently predict. Like swords, books have symbolic power. Like fireplaces, they induce a sense of comfort and warmth. And, perhaps, similar to sails, they make a useful backup for when the lights go out.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage .is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D.You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn't an either/or proposition (命题) , although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths ) related fields can make it seem that way.
The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also asserts that the study of the humanities (人文学科) and social sciences must remain central components of America's educational system at all levels. Both areas are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become innovative (创新) leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides.
Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates' job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under these circumstances, it's natural to look for what may appear to be the most "practical" way out of the problem: "Major in a subject designed to get you a job" seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as "soft" often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily.
Moreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there's little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight-picked up from science, arts, and technology-to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the United States.

56. What does the latest congressional report suggest?
A) STEM-related subjects help students find jobs in the information society.
B) The humanities and STEM subjects should be given equal importance.
C) The liberal arts in higher education help enrich students' spiritual life.
D) Higher education should be adjusted to the practical needs of society.

57. What is the main concern of students when they choose a major?
A) Their interest in relevant subjects.
B) The academic value of the courses.
C) The quality of education to receive.
D) Their chances of getting a good job.

58. What does the author say about the so-called soft, subjects?
A) They benefit students in their future life.
B) They broaden students' range of interests.
C) They improve students' communication skills.
D) They are essential to students' healthy growth.

59. What kind of job applicants do employers look for?
A) Those who have a strong sense of responsibility.
B) Those who are good at solving practical problems.
C) Those who are likely to become innovative leaders.
D) Those who have received a well-rounded education.

60. What advice does the author give to college students?
A) Seize opportunities to tap their potential.
B) Try to take a variety of practical courses.
C) Prepare themselves for different job options.
D) Adopt a flexible approach to solving problems.


Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

Energy independence. It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? If you think so, you're not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American presidents for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession.
"Energy independence" and its rhetorical (修辞的) companion "energy security" are, however, slippery concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it we want independence from, exactly?
Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere.
The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle (涓涓细流) of biofuel (生物燃料) available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.
Second, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to endure the environmental impacts of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports?
Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.
There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to maintain its economy. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices. At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world.

Translation
Chinese educators have long known that, reading is of great importance to a nation. Some of them even proposed to establish the National Reading Day in 2003. They emphasized that people should read good books, especially the classic ones. By reading, people can better learn to be grateful, responsible and cooperative, the very basic qualities education intends to foster. Reading is especially important for students in the primary school and middle school; if the interest of reading is not fostered at that critical period, it will be quite difficult to cultivate the habit of reading later.

I Cry, Therefore I Am
A) In 2008, at a German zoo, a gorilla (大猩猩) named Gana gave birth to a male infant, who died after three months. Photographs of Gana, looking stricken and inconsolable (伤心欲绝的) , attracted crowds to the zoo. Sad as the scene was, the humans, not Gana, were the only ones crying. The notion that animals can weep has no scientific basis. Years of observations by biologists Dian Fossey, who observed gorillas, and Jane Goodall, who worked with chimpanzees (黑猩猩) , could not prove that animals cry tears from emotion.
B) It's true that many animals shed tears, especially in response to pain. Tears protect the eye by keeping it moist. But crying as an expression of feeling is unique to humans and has played an essential role in human evolution and the development of human cultures.
C) Within two days an infant can imitate sad and happy faces. If an infant does not cry out, it is unlikely to get the attention it needs to survive. Around 3 months, the relationship between the human infant and its environment takes on a more organized communicative role, and tearful crying begins to serve interpersonal purposes: the search for comfort and pacification (抚慰). As we get older, crying becomes a tool of social interaction; grief and joy, shame and pride, fear and manipulation.
D) Tears are as universal as laughter, and grief is more complex than joy. But although we all cry, we do so in different ways. Women cry more frequently and intensely than men, especially when exposed to emotional events. Like crying, depression is, around the world, more commonly seen in women than in men. One explanation might be that women, who despite decades of social advances still suffer from economic inequality, discrimination (歧视) and even violence, might have more to cry about. Men not only cry for shorter periods than women, but they also are less inclined to explain their tears, usually shed them more quietly, and tend more frequently to apologize when they cry openly. Men, like women, report crying at the death of a loved one and in response to a moving religious experience. They are more likely than women to cry when their core identities-as providers and protectors, as fathers and fighters-are questioned.
E) People who score on personality tests as more sympathetic cry more than those who are more rigid or have more self-control. Frequency of crying varies widely: some shed tears at any novel or movie, others only a handful of times in their lives. Crying in response to stress and conflict in the home, or after emotional trauma (创伤) , lasts much longer than tears induced by everyday sadness-which in turn last longer than tears of delight and joy.
F) Sadness is our primary association with crying, but the fact is that people report feeling happier after crying. Surveys estimate that 85% of women and 73% of men report feeling better after shedding tears. Surprisingly, crying is more commonly associated with minor forms of depression than with major depression involving suicidal thoughts.
G) People widely report that crying relieves tension, restores emotional balance and provides "catharsis," a washing out of bad feelings. The term "catharsis" has religious implications of removing evil and sin; it's no surprise that religious ceremonies are, around the world, one of the main settings for the release of tears.
H) Crying is a nearly universal sign of grief, though some mourners report that, despite genuine sorrow, they cannot shed tears-sometimes even for years after their loved one has gone. Unlike today, when the privacy of grief is more respected, the public or ceremonial shedding of tears, at the graveside of a spouse or the funeral of a king or queen, was once considered socially or even politically essential.
I) Crying has also served other social purposes. Rousseau wrote in his Confessions that while he considered tears the most, powerful expression of love, he also just liked to cry over nothing.
J) The association of tears with art has ancient roots. The classic Greek tragedies of the fifth century B. C. were primarily celebrations of gods. Tragedies, like poetry and music, were staged religious events. Even then it was recognized that crying in response to drama brought pleasure.
K) I have argued that there are neurobiological (神经生物方面的) associations linking the arts and mood disorders. When I lecture on crying, I ask my audience to let me know, by a show of hands, which art forms most move them to tears. About 80% say music, followed closely by novels (74%), but then the figures fail sharply, to 43% , for poetry, and 10 -22% for paintings, sculpture and architecture.
L) The physical act of crying is mainly one of breathing in air, which is why we choke up when we weep. This suggests to language scientists that emotional crying evolved before language, perhaps explaining why tears communicate states of mind and feelings that are often so difficult to express in words. Of course, from an evolutionary perspective, recognition of emotion (usually through facial gesture) was essential for survival.
M) The earliest humans arrived several million years ago, but only 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, did cultures, language, religion and the arts arise. Along the way, tears became more than a biological necessity to lubricate (润滑) the eye and developed into a sign of intense emotion and a signal of social bonding. The development of self-consciousness and the notion of individual identity, or ego; storytelling about the origins of the world, the creation of humanity and life after death; and the ability to feel others' sadness-all were critical parts of the neurobiological changes that made us human.
N) More recently, we've learned from neuroscience that certain brain circuits (回路) are activated (激活) , rapidly and unconsciously, when we see another in emotional distress. In short, our brain evolved circuits to allow us to experience sympathy, which in turn made civilization, and an ethics based on sympathy, possible. So the next time you reach a tissue box, or sob on a friend's shoulder, or shed tears at the movies, stop and reflect on why we cry and what it means to cry. Because ultimately, while we love to cry, we also cry to love.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage .is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D.You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

Hospitals, hoping to curb medical error, have invested heavily to put computers, smartphones and other devices into the hands of medical staff for instant access to patient data, drug information and case studies.
But like many cures, this solution has come with an unintended side effect: doctors and nurses can be focused on the screen and not the patient, even during moments of critical care. A poll showed that half of medical technicians had admitted texting during a procedure.
This phenomenon has set off an intensifying discussion at hospitals and medical schools about a problem perhaps best described as "distracted doctoring." In response, some hospitals have begun limiting the use of electronic devices in critical settings, while schools have started reminding medical students to focus on patients instead of devices.
"You justify carrying devices around the hospital to do medical records, but you can surf the Internet or do Facebook, and sometimes Facebook is more tempting," said Dr. Peter Papadakos at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
"My gut filing (本能的感觉) is lives are in danger," said Dr. Papadakos," We're not educating people about the problem, and it's getting worse. "
A survey of 439 medical technicians found that 55 percent of technicians who monitor bypass machines acknowledged that they had talked on cellphones during heart surgery. Half said they had texted while in surgery. The study concluded," Such distractions have the potential to be disastrous. "
Medical professionals have always faced interruptions from cellphones, and multitasking is simply a fact of life for many medical jobs. What has changed, say doctors, especially younger ones, is that they face increasing pressure to interact with their devices.
The pressure stems from a mantra (信条) of modem medicine that patient care must be "data driven," and informed by the latest, instantly accessible information. By many accounts, the technology has helped reduce medical error by providing instant access to patient data or prescription details.
Dr. Peter Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, said technology "offers great potential in health care," but he added that doctors' first priority should be with the patient.

56. Why do hospitals equip their staff with computers, smartphones and other devices?
A) To reduce medical error.
B) To cope with emergencies.
C) To facilitate administration.
D) To simplify medical procedures.

57. What does the author refer to by "distracted doctoring"?
A) The disservice done by modern devices to doctors, nurses, as well as patients.
B) The tendency of medical institutions encouraging the use of modem devices.
C) The problem of devices preventing doctors from focusing on their patients.
D) The phenomenon of medical staff attending to personal affairs while working.

58. What does Dr. Peter Papadakos worry about?
A) Medical students are not adequately trained to use modem technology.
B) Doctors' interaction with their devices may endanger patients' lives.
C) Doctors are relying too heavily on modem electronic technology.
D) Pressures on the medical profession may become overwhelming.

59. Why do doctors feel increasing pressure to use modem devices?
A) Patients trust doctors who use modem technology.
B) Use of modem devices adds to hospitals' revenues.
C) Data is given too much importance in patient care.
D) Patients' data has to be revised from time to time.

60. What is Peter Carmel's advice to doctors?
A) They follow closely the advances in medical science.
B) They focus their attention on the patient's condition.
C) They observe hospital rules and regulations.
D) They make the best use of modem devices.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

I have closely watched my generation, known as I he Millennials, for 29 years now, Joel Stem wrote an extensive piece on Millennials and he remains rather optimistic about our potential.
I hesitate to share his optimism because of a paradox (矛盾的现象) we seem to exhibit, namely, that there are more avenues for us to entertain ourselves than ever before, yet we are more bored than ever before.
Entertainment has never been more varied. We have more cable channels, television shows, and movies than ever before. Internet providers allow instant viewing of almost any movie or television program ever created. Social drinking and partying are also widely available for Millennials. Every generation develops these habits at a certain age, but Millennials seem to be extending this phase of life as they postpone marriage.
Some of this is undoubtedly due to The Great Recession. Millennials are having a difficult time finding jobs; only 47 percent of 16-to-24-year-olds are employed, the smallest share since government started recording data in 1948.
But do Millennial* respond to these economic troubles by doing whatever it takes to make ends meet? Hardly, In fact, of the four generations Pew Research has data for, the Millennial generation does not cite work ethic (勤奋工作) as distinctive of itself. Millennials want to save the world, but they sit and wait for that world-changing opportunity to be handed to them. Instead of working 2-3 jobs, launching a business, or doing what it takes to succeed, they retreat. Millennials may be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than their parents, but with this response to adversity (逆境) , perhaps deservingly so.
Much ink has been spilled in management books discussing how to get the most out of these youths in the workplace. Largely, they come to the same conclusion; Millennials are entitled, over-confident, and expect too much too quickly. We should not be surprised. Today's young adults were raised by parents who made sure to boost their self-esteem at every turn, telling them they could achieve whatever they set their minds to, and handing out prizes for the sixth place.

A) They show little interest in entertainment.

62. How do Millennials feel about their life?
A) They can hardly do anything about it.
B) There is little in it to get excited about.
C) It is not as good as their parents'.
D) It is full of opportunities for success.

63. In what way are Millennials different from previous generations according to Pew Research?
A) They spend less time socializing.
B) They are indifferent to others.
C) They do not value hard work.
D) They are more independent.

64. What should Millennials do according to the author?

　　Among the kinds of social gestures most significant for second-language teachers are those which are ___(26)___?in form but different in meaning in the two cultures. For example, a Colombian who wants someone to ___(27)___ him often signals with a hand movement in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped, point downward as they move rapidly ___(28)___ .Speakers or English have a similar gesture through the hand may not be cupped and the fingers may be held more loosely, but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away, quite the ___(29)___ of the Colombian gesture. Again, in Colombian, a speaker of English would have to know that when he ___(30)___height he most choose between different gestures depending on whether he is ___(31)___ a human being or an animal. If he keeps the palm of the hand ___(32)___the floor, as he would in his own culture when making known the height of a child, for example, he will very likely be greeted by laughter, in Colombia this gesture is___(33)___for the description of animals. In order to describe human beings he should keep the palm of his hand ___(34)___to the floor. Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create not only humorous but also___(35)___ moment. In both of the examples above, speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically, but its meaning differs sharply.

　　Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　Global warming is a trend toward warmer conditions around the world. Part of the warming is natural; we have experienced a 20,000-year-long warming as the last ice age ended and the ice__36___away,However , we have already reached temperatures that are in __37__with other minimum-ice periods, so continued warming is likely not natural. We are __38__to a predicted worldwide in increase in temperatures__39__betweem 1℃ and 6℃ over the next 100 years. The warming will be more__40__in some areas, less in other, and some places may even cool off.

　　The fact remains, however, that it will likely get warmer, on __43__, everywhere. Scientists are in general agreement that the warmer conditions we have been experiencing are at least in part the result of a human-induced global warming trend. Some scientists___44__that the changes?we are seeing fall within the range of random(无规律的)variation-some years are cold, others warm, and we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years__45___--but that is becoming an increasingly rare interpretation in the face of continued and increasing warm conditions.

　　Section B
　　Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　
　　The End of the Book?
　　[A] Amazon, by far the largest bookseller in the country, reported on May 19 that it is now selling more books in its electronic Kindle format than in the old paper-and-ink format. That is remarkable, considering that the Kindle has only been around for four years. E-books now account for 14 percent of all book sales in the country and are increasing far faster than overall book sales. E-book sales are up 146 percent over last year, while hardback sales increased 6 percent and paperbacks decreased 8 percent.
　　
　　[B] Does this spell the doom of the physical book? Certainly not immediately, and perhaps not at all. What it does mean is that the book business will go through a transformation in the next decade or so more profound than any it has seen since Gutenberg introduced printing from moveable type in the 1450s.
　　
　　[C] Physical books will surely become much rarer in the marketplace. Mass market paperbacks, which have been declining for years anyway, will probably disappear, as will hardbacks for mysteries, thrillers, “romance fiction,” etc. Such books, which only rarely end up in permanent collections, either private or public, will probably only be available as e-books within a few years. Hardback and trade paperbacks for “serious” nonfiction and fiction will surely last longer. Perhaps it will become the mark of an author to reckon with that he or she is still published in hard copy.
　　
　　[D] As for children’s books, who knows? Children’s books are like dog food in that the purchasers are not the consumers, so the market (and the marketing) is inherently strange.
　　
　　[E] For clues to the book’s future, let’s look at some examples of technological change and see what happened to the old technology.
　　
　　[F] One technology replaces another only because the new technology is better, cheaper, or both. The greater the difference, the sooner and more thoroughly the new technology replaces the old. Printing with moveable type on paper dramatically reduced the cost of producing a book compared with the old-fashioned ones handwritten on vellum, which comes from sheepskin. A Bible—to be sure, a long book—required vellum made from 300 sheepskins and countless man-hours of labor. Before printing arrived, a Bible cost more than a middle-class house. There were perhaps 50,000 books in all of Europe in 1450. By 1500 there were 10 million.
　　
　　[G] But while printing quickly caused the hand written book to die out, handwriting lingered on (继续存在) well into the 16th century. Very special books are still occasionally produced on vellum, but they are one-of-a-kind show pieces.
　　
　　[H]Sometimes a new technology doesn’t drive the old one out, but only parts of it while forcing the rest to evolve. The movies were widely predicted to drive live theater out of the marketplace, but they didn’t, because theater turned out to have qualities movies could not reproduce. Equally, TV was supposed to replace movies but, again, did not.
　　
　　[I] Movies did, however, fatally impact some parts of live theater. And while TV didn’t kill movies, it did kill second-rate pictures, shorts, and cartoons.
　　
　　[J] Nor did TV kill radio. Comedy and drama shows (“Jack Benny,” “Amos and Andy,” “The Shadow”) all migrated to television. But because you can’t drive a car and watch television at the same time, rush hour became radio’s prime, while music, talk, and news radio greatly enlarged their audiences. Radio is today a very different business than in the late 1940s and a much larger one.
　　
　　[K] Sometimes old technology lingers for centuries because of its symbolic power. Mounted cavalry (骑兵) replaced the chariot (二轮战车) on the battlefield around 1000 BC. But chariots maintained their place in parades and triumphs right up until the end of the Roman Empire 1,500 years later. The sword hasn’t had a military function for a hundred years, but is still part of an officer’s full-dress uniform, precisely because a sword always symbolized “an officer and a gentleman.”
　　
　　[L] Sometimes new technology is a little cranky (不稳定的) at first. Television repairman was a common occupation in the 1950s, for instance. And so the old technology remains as a backup. Steamships captured the North Atlantic passenger business from sail in the 1840s because of its much greater speed. But steamships didn’t lose their sails until the 1880s, because early marine engines had a nasty habit of breaking down. Until ships became large enough (and engines small enough) to mount two engines side by side, they needed to keep sails. (The high cost of steam and the lesser need for speed kept the majority of the world’s ocean freight moving by sail until the early years of the 20th century.)
　　
　　[M] Then there is the fireplace. Central heating was present in every upper-and middle-class home by the second half of the 19th century. But functioning fireplaces remain to this day a powerful selling point in a house or apartment. I suspect the reason is a deep-rooted love of the fire. Fire was one of the earliest major technological advances for humankind, providing heat, protection, and cooked food (which is much easier to cat and digest). Human control of fire goes back far enough (over a million years) that evolution could have produced a genetic leaning towards fire as a central aspect of human life.
　　
　　[N] Books—especially books the average person could afford—haven’t been around long enough to produce evolutionary change in humans. But they have a powerful hold on many people nonetheless, a hold extending far beyond their literary content. At their best, they are works of art and there is a tactile（触觉的）pleasure in books necessarily lost in e-book versions. The ability to quickly thumb through pages is also lost. And a room with books in it induces, at least in some, a feeling not dissimilar to that of a fire in the fireplace on a cold winter’s night.
　　
　　[O] For these reasons I think physical books will have a longer existence as a commercial product than some currently predict. Like swords, books have symbolic power. Like fireplaces, they induce a sense of comfort and warmth. And, perhaps, similar to sails, they make a useful back-up for when the lights go out.
　　
　　46. Authors still published in printed versions will be considered important ones.
　　47. Some people are still in favor of printed books because of the sense of touch they can provide.
　　48. The radio business has changed greatly and now attracts more listeners.
　　49. Contrary to many people’s prediction of its death, the film industry survived.
　　50. Remarkable changes have taken place in the book business.
　　51. Old technology sometimes continues to exist because of its reliability.
　　52. The increase of e-book sales will force the book business to make changes not seen for centuries.
　　53. A new technology is unlikely to take the place of an old one without a clear advantage.
　　54. Paperbacks of popular literature are more likely to be replaced by e-books.
　　55. A house with a fireplace has a stronger appeal to buyers.
　　
　　Section C 
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
　　
　　Passage One 
　　Questions 56 to 60are based on the following passage. 
　　The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn’t an either/or proposition(命题)，although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM（science, technology, engineering, maths）-related fields can make it seem that way. 
　　The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also asserts that the study of the humanities (人文学科)and social sciences must remain central components of America’s educational system at all levels. Both are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become innovative（创新的)leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides. 
　　Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates’ job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under these circumstances, it’s natural to look for what may appear to be the most “practical” way out of the problem “Major in a subject designed to get you a job” seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as “soft” often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily. 
　　Moreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there’s little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight—picked up from science, arts, and technology—to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the United States. 
　　
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。 
　　56. What does the latest congressional report suggest?
　　A) STEM-related subjects help students find jobs in the information society.
　　B) The humanities and STEM subjects should be given equal importance.
　　C) The liberal arts in higher education help enrich students’ spiritual life.
　　D) Higher education should be adjusted to the practical needs of society. 
　　57. What is the main concern of students when they choose a major?
　　A) Their interest in relevant subjects.
　　B) The academic value of the courses.
　　C) The quality of education to receive.
　　D) Their chances of getting a good job. 
　　58. What does the author say about the so called soft subjects?

　　Passage Two
　　Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Energy independence. It has a nice ring to it. Doesn’t it? If you think so, you’re not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession.
　　“Energy independence” and its rhetorical (修辞的) companion “energy security” are, however, slippery concepts that are rarely though through. What is it we want independence from, exactly?
　　Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that old from elsewhere.
　　The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle（涓涓细流）of biofuel（生物燃料）available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.
　　Second, Americans have basically decided that they don’t really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to endure the environmental impacts of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports?
　　Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don’t read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.
　　There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to maintain its economy. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices, At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world.

　　Part Ⅳ Translation (30 minutes)
　　Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.
　　
　　翻译题目一：为了促进教育公平，中国已投入360亿元，用于改善农村地区教育设施和中强中西部地区农村义务教育（compulsory education）。这些资金用于改善教学设施、购买书籍，使16万多所中小学受益。资金还用于购置音乐和绘画器材。现在农村和山区的儿童可以与沿海城市的儿童一样上音乐和绘画课。一些为接受更好教育而转往城市上学的学生如今又回到了本地农村学校就读。
　　
　　翻译题目二：中国应进一步发展核能，因为核电目前只占其总发电量的2%，该比例在所有核国家中居第30位，几乎是最低的。2011年3月日本核电站事故后，中国的核能开发停了下来，中止审批新的核电站，并开展全国性的核安全检查。到2012年10月，审批才能又谨慎的恢复。随着技术和安全措施的改进，发生核事故的可能性完全可以降低到最低限度。换句话说核能是可以安全开发和利用的。 
　　
　　翻译题目三：中国教育工作者早就认识到读书对于国家的重要意义，有些教育工作者2003年就建议设立全民读书日。他们强调，人们应当读好书，尤其是经典著作。通过阅读，人们能更好地学会感恩、有责任心和与人合作，而教育的目的正是要培养这些基本素质，阅读对于中小学生尤为重要，假如他们没有这个关键时期培养阅读的兴趣，以后要养成阅读的习惯就很难了。
　　
　　2014年6月大学英语四级答案解析（233网校）
　　写作
　　解析：与去年的图画作文模式不同，今年又重新回到了话题作文的形式，并且所给话题也是考生非常熟悉的，很容易展开思路。更令人惊奇的是今年的作文虽然有三个话题，但是话题设定的背景信息是趋同的，都是说外国朋友要来中国或来你的家乡或来你的学校，让你介绍一下中国/家乡/学校的特色，目的还是为了推介我们本土的文化特色，看来出题人是越来越看重中国传统文化的弘扬了。去年的翻译题当中就出现了一系列的对中国传统文化的介绍，像中餐，中国结，茶文化，中国园林，中秋等等。所以说，文化题材，特别是有关中国文化特色的题材要成为以后大家复习的重点内容。以后备考四六级的同学一定要多联系这个文化题材的翻译和写作。 
　　
　　【作文范文】 
　　If a foreign friend is coming to visit our campus, I would show him or her our school library and the dinning hall. There are several reasons to account for my recommendations.

　　Among the kinds of social gestures most significant for second-language teachers are those which are ___(26)___?in form but different in meaning in the two cultures. For example, a Colombian who wants someone to ___(27)___ him often signals with a hand movement in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped, point downward as they move rapidly ___(28)___ .Speakers or English have a similar gesture through the hand may not be cupped and the fingers may be held more loosely, but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away, quite the ___(29)___ of the Colombian gesture. Again, in Colombian, a speaker of English would have to know that when he ___(30)___height he most choose between different gestures depending on whether he is ___(31)___ a human being or an animal. If he keeps the palm of the hand ___(32)___the floor, as he would in his own culture when making known the height of a child, for example, he will very likely be greeted by laughter, in Colombia this gesture is___(33)___for the description of animals. In order to describe human beings he should keep the palm of his hand ___(34)___to the floor. Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create not only humorous but also___(35)___ moment. In both of the examples above, speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically, but its meaning differs sharply.
　　答案： 
　　26. identical 
　　27. approach 
　　28. back and forth 
　　29. opposite 
　　30. indicates 
　　31. referring to 
　　32. parallel to 
　　33. reserved 
　　34. at the right angle 
　　35. embarrassing 
　　
　　选词填空
　　36. I) melted
　　本空是谓语，需要动词，且空前并列成分谓语用的是过去式ended，因此需要过去式。备选的有melted(融化)和resolved(决心)，能与空前ice构成合理意思、且与空后away构成搭配的只有melted，表示“冰川融化”。
　　
　　37. G) line
　　本空空前是介词，因此需要名词性成分，且要考虑与空后的with构成搭配。符合要求的只有line(in line with，与……一致)。意思是我们已经接近“与其他最小冰川期时一致的温度”。
　　
　　38. C) contributing
　　前句用完成时表示已经达到的状态，本句we are描述的则是正在发生的过程，需要动词的ing形式，且要考虑与空后的介词to构成搭配。备选的有appealing to(呼吁、上诉)、contributing to(促成、导致)，ranging后不直接与介词to构成搭配。意思合理的只有contributing，为“我们正促成世界范围内气温的升高”。
　　
　　39. K) ranging
　　本空引领的是temperature的后置定语，需要动词分词。备选的有appealing(呼吁、上诉)、ranging(范围在……)和resolved(决心)。空后的between 1℃ and 6 ℃明显是范围区间，因此ranging合乎语义。range between/from A and B为常用搭配。
　　
　　40. D) dramatic
　　本空作为表语，且空前有more，提示了本空需要形容词。备选的有appealing(有吸引力的)、dramatic(戏剧性的、突发的)和sensible(明智的)。这里描述的是气候变化的效果，因此dramatic意思更合适，意为“某些地方的气候变化会更加戏剧化”。后半句提到的有些地方可能cool off(变冷)也是暗示气候变化的突发及剧烈。
　　
　　41. F) impact
　　空前的the暗示本空需要名词。备选的有average(平均)、impact(影响)和shock(震惊)。impact和shock都能用于与warming构成搭配，但后面提到的different depending on where you are提示了本空应当是一个较为宽泛的概念，故impact更合适，意为“气候变暖的影响因所在地不同而不同”。
　　
　　42. A) appealing
　　空前的and提示了本空与and前的habitable(宜居的)同词性且义相近。因此本空需要形容词，备选的有appealing(有吸引力的)和sensible(明智的)。意思上与habitable更能并列、描述本句所说的Siberia and northern Canada的影视appealing，表示“西伯利亚和加拿大北部可能会变得更宜居、更吸引人”。
　　
　　43. B) average
　　空前介词on提示了本空需要名词性成分与之构成搭配。备选的有average(平均)和shock(震惊)。这里意思更合理的是average，且on average是固定搭配“平均地”。
　　
　　44. H) maintain
　　本空需要谓语，且前句所用为一般现在时，考虑到本句主语为复数scientists，因此本空需要动词原形。备选的有maintain(维持、坚称)、persist(坚持)和shock(震惊)。但persist为不及物动词，而本空后有宾语从句;shock意思不合适是且一般后面接人。因此只能选maintain。意为“有些科学家坚称……”。
　　
　　45. L) recently
　　本空所在句不缺其它成分，本空需要副词。备选的又frequently(频繁地)和recently(最近)。空前提到科学家认为气候变化无规律，有些年冷、有些年热(some years are cold, others warm)。本空所在的we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years应当是顺着科学家的观点而来，解释我们现在所处的正好是偏热的年份期。因此本空用recently强调当下更佳。若选frequently表示“我们频繁处在偏热的年份”，则与科学家所持的气温冷热无规律交替的观点不相符合。
　　
　　段落匹配
　　46. Authors still published in printed versions will be considered important ones.
　　答案：C
　　解析：对应C段末句。printed versions(纸质版本)对应hard copy(印刷版本)，be considered important ones(被认为重要)对应become the mark…to reckon(认为是标志)。
　　
　　47. Some people are still in favor of printed books because of the sense of touch they can provide.
　　答案：N
　　解析：对应N段第三句提到的tactile pleasure in books(书本的触觉上的愉悦)。
　　
　　48. The radio business has changed greatly and now attracts more listeners.
　　答案：J
　　解析：对应J段最后两句。changed greatly(巨大改变)对应a very different business(相当不同的行业)，attracts more listeners(吸引更多听众)对应enlarged their audience(扩大受众面)。
　　
　　49. Contrary to many people’s prediction of its death, the film industry survived.
　　答案：H
　　解析：对应H段第二句。many people’s prediction对应widely predicted。
　　
　　50. Remarkable changes have taken place in the book business.
　　答案：A
　　解析：这是对A段所描述的电子书在近几年内大幅增长的现象的概括。
　　
　　51. Old technology sometimes continues to exist because of its reliability.
　　答案：L
　　解析：对应L段第三句。continues to exist(继续存在)对应remain(保持)，reliability(可靠)对应backup(支持、后盾)。
　　
　　52. The increase of e-book sales will force the book business to make changes not seen for centuries.
　　答案：B
　　解析：对应B段第三句。make changes(做出改变)对应go through a transformation(经历转变)，not seen for centuries是对该句后部分时间表达的概括。
　　
　　53. A new technology is unlikely to take the place of an old one without a clear advantage.
　　答案：F
　　解析：对应F段第一句。a clear advantage(明显优势)岁对better, cheaper or both的概括。take the place of(代替)对应replace(代替)。
　　
　　54. Paperbacks of popular literature are more likely to be replaced by e-books.
　　答案：C
　　解析：完全对应C段第二句。
　　
　　55. A house with a fireplace has a stronger appeal to buyers.

　　仔细阅读
　　Passage One
　　56. What does the latest congressional report suggest?
　　A) STEM-related subjects help students find jobs in the information society.
　　B) The humanities and STEM subjects should be given equal importance.
　　C) The liberal arts in higher education help enrich students’ spiritual life.
　　D) Higher education should be adjusted to the practical needs of society.
　　解析：56.B
　　本题属于观点型细节题，问最近的一次国会报告提出了什么建议。根据题干定位词latest congressional report 定位到文章第二段第一句。Acknowledge意为“承认”，引出观点。前半句非常简单，“最近的一次国会报告承认了技术训练的关键性”，后半句以but进行语义转折，意为“但是他们也认为关于人文学科和社会科学的研究都必须在任何等级的美国教育系统中作为核心部分”。之后的both areas are critical to…都是在描述这两门学科对塑造人才的积极影响，可以略读。
　　再来看四个选项。
　　A. STEM在第一段有解释，分别由science, technology, engineering和maths的首字母组成，意为“科学”，“技术”，“工程学”和“数学”。所以A选项的意思是“与STEM相关的学科可以帮助学生在信息社会找到工作”。文章对于STEM的影响的描述只出现在第二段的最后一句话，但没有提及能帮助找工作，属于无中生有，排除。
　　B. 意思是“人文学科和STEM应该被给与相同的重要性”。通过第二段第一句话but后面的内容可以确定B为正选。选项唯一的难点是STEM在文中是以social science进行同义替换的方式出现的。Should be given equal importance和原文的must remain central components of …对应。
　　C. “高等教育的文科能帮助学生丰富精神世界”。C选项的干扰性同样来自于第二段的最后一句，但需要注意的是原文所说的spiritual enrichment是由reflection on the great ideas of mankind提供而非选项所指的liberal arts. 故C排除。
　　D. “高等教育应该适用于社会的实际需求”。这个选项属于无中生有，比较容易排除。
　　
　　57. What is the main concern of students when they choose a major?
　　A) Their interest in relevant subjects.
　　B) The academic value of the courses.
　　C) The quality of education to receive.
　　D) Their chances of getting a good job.
　　解析：57.D
　　题目问学生选择专业时主要关心什么。结合顺序原则可以大致定位到第三段，本段前两句话讲述了家长和学生们在为高等教育做出巨大投资之后所以担心的问题就是市场的变化可能会导致孩子们将来就业机会变少以及工资降低。并且根据这个大背景提出了一个公认的解决的办法，也就是由题干中的major定位到的本段第三句，“Major in a subject designed to get you a job”seems the obvious answer to some,… 意思是“选择一个为给你找到工作而设计的专业是大部分人认可大答案”。
　　A.“对相关专业的兴趣。”
　　B.“课程的学术价值。”
　　C.“接受的教育的质量。”
　　D.“找到工作的机会。”原文的同义改写，锁定D答案。
　　
　　58. What does the author say about the so called soft subjects?
　　A) The benefit students in their future life.
　　B) They broaden students’ range of interests.
　　C) They improve students’ communication skills.
　　D) They are essential to students’ healthy growth.
　　解析：58.A
　　问作者如何评价所谓的“软”学科。本题答案依然出自于第三段，57题定位句的后半句，即though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as “soft” often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run.本句的disciplines与subjects都是“学科”的意思，所以这句话可以翻译成“尽管他们忽略一个事实，那就是人文学科中那些被描述成“软”学科的，通常能够能够促成将来的就业和成功”。
　　A.“他们会在将来的生活使学生受益。”benefit与原文的lead to employment and success对应，in their future与原文的in the long run对应。A为正选。
　　B.“他们能扩大学生的兴趣。”
　　C.“他们能提高学生的交流能力。”
　　D.“他们对于学生的健康成长至关重要。”BCD均为无中生有，直接排除。
　　
　　59. What kind of job applicants do employers look for?
　　A) Those who have a strong sense of responsibility.
　　B) Those who are good at solving practical problems.
　　C) Those who are likely to become innovative leaders.
　　D) Those who have received a well-rounded education.
　　解析：59.D
　　问老板想找什么类型的应聘者。答案出自第三段最后一句话，employers have expressed a preference for students who received a broadly-based education that has taught them how to write well, think carefully, research creatively, and communicate easily. 这句话非常直白地告诉我们老板所偏爱的员工是接受过broadly-based education的人，即“全方位教育”，所以与这句话有相同描述的选项即为正选。
　　A.“那些有强烈责任感的人。”
　　B.“那些能够解决实际问题的人。”
　　C.“那些有可能成为有创新力的领导的人。”
　　D.“那些接受过全方位教育的人。”well-rounded是broadly-based的同义改写，所以D为正选。
　　
　　60. What advice does the author give to college students?
　　A) Seize opportunities to tap their potential.
　　B) Try to take a variety of practical courses.
　　C) Prepare themselves for different job options.
　　D) Adopt a flexible approach to solving problems.
　　解析：60.D
　　问作者给大学生提了什么建议。全文只有四段话，前三段都已经用于解决之前的四道题，所以最后一题自然而然地定位到最后一段。并且由第一句里的students should…可以看出这段话主要是在讨论相关的建议。由于没有具体的定位词可以参考，所以一般情况下咱们需要快速读完整段话再一一对应选项看有没有符合的内容。
　　A.“寻找机会开发自己的潜力。”
　　B.“试着参加各种实际课程。”
　　C.“为不同的工作选择做好准备。”
　　D.“采取灵活的方法来解决问题。”
　　本题选择D。答案出自于本段的最后两句话。意思是“能在这种环境下做到最好的一定是那些已经让自己做好随时变通的准备的人。”以及最后作者还评价“能够利用任何可用的工具——不管是来自己于哪个学科，去解决问题，并且利用机会表现自己”的能力会产生很大的帮助。D选项就是对原文的归纳和总结，ABC属于无中生有的干扰项。
　　
　　Passage Two
　　
　　61. What does the author say about energy independence for America?
　　A) It sounds very attractive. 
　　B) It ensures national security. 
　　C) It will bring oil prices down. 
　　D) It has long been everyone’s dream.
　　解析：61、A 此题并非主旨题，按顺序原则及题干信息定位首段。 “If you think so, you’re not alone”表明作者持有同样想法，答案往“so”前面找——“Energy independence. It has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?” have a nice ring to sth.表示“听起来不错，令人向往”的意思，选项A的attractive是其同义改写。即使不了解短语，根据nice可判断正态度，答案选A。 
　　
　　62. What does the author think of biofuels?
　　A) They keep America’s economy running healthily.
　　B) They prove to be a good alternative to petroleum.
　　C) They do not provide a sustainable energy supply.
　　D) They cause serious damage to the environment.
　　解析：62、D 由题干信息biofuels定位在第四段落。定位句本身出现but强调：“but most biofuels are a Faustian bargain, causing economic waste and environmental destruction. ”but后面的强调才是作者对于biofuels的真正想法——causing economic waste and environmental destruction。选项中AB选项均为正态度，与原文不符直接排除。原文中C选项为干扰选项，“可持续的能源供给”，文章未提及。
　　
　　63. Why does America rely heavily on oil imports?
　　A) It wants to expand its storage of crude oil.
　　B) Its own oil reserves are quickly running out.
　　C) It wants to keep its own environment intact.
　　D) Its own oil production falls short of demand.
　　解析：63 、C 按照阅读出题的“顺序原则”直接看到下一段(第五段)。首句“Americans have basically decided that they don’t really want to produce all their own oil. ”美国人不愿意自己产油，是63题题干信息当中“…America rely on heavily on oil imports”的同义改写。根据“金三句原则”定位到定位句的下一句“the American people…decided that they value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. ” 相比从国外进口石油，美国人更看重环境质量，由此判断，答案选C——“keep environment intact”。
　　
　　64. What does the author say about oil trade?
　　A) It proves profitable to both sides. C) It makes for economic prosperity.
　　B) It improves economic efficiency. D) It saves the cost of oil exploration.
　　解析：64、A 根据定位词oil trade以及顺序原则定位到文章最后一段。根据文章主旨和前文内容，或者是根据定位段信息可知“United States imports a great of energy”，让能源输出国有利可图，而同时“At the same time”，美国本身也有自身利益——“we derive massive economic benefits…when we engage in energy trade around the world.”，答案选A——“It proves profitable to both sides”。
　　
　　65. What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
　　A) To justify America’s dependence on oil imports.
　　B) To arouse Americans’ awareness of the energy crisis.
　　C) To stress the importance of energy conservation.
　　D) To explain the increase of international oil trade.
　　解析：65、A 问作者写作意图，即问全文主旨。根据各段首句以及串联五个题干信息可得知，文章主要讨论“America”的“energy independence”，就可以直接排除BCD选项了。为做题保险，还要进一步确认。由文章末端的结尾“At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits…when we engage in energy trade around the world.” 可得知作者态度还是站在“oil imports”这一边的，因为可以得到“massive economic benefits”，所以作者还是在为“oil imports”而申辩的。答案选A。

　　Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.
　　翻译题目一：为了促进教育公平，中国已投入360亿元，用于改善农村地区教育设施和中强中西部地区农村义务教育（compulsory education）。这些资金用于改善教学设施、购买书籍，使16万多所中小学受益。资金还用于购置音乐和绘画器材。现在农村和山区的儿童可以与沿海城市的儿童一样上音乐和绘画课。一些为接受更好教育而转往城市上学的学生如今又回到了本地农村学校就读。
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　
　　<考点解析>
　　本次四级翻译要求我们总共翻译5句话，重点考查了下面这些知识点。
　　① 为了促进…in order to promote…
　　这里的“为了”除了用in order to是常想到的表达之外，for/for the purpose of。.均可灵活替换。此外，“促进”除了可以用promote,还可以用其它的同义词替换，比如further/boost等。
　　② 360亿元：36 billion
　　注意：数字的表达。如果写成360 billion or 36 billions都是错误的！
　　③ 改善教育设施和加强农村义务教育
　　improve educational facilities and strengthen rural compulsory education
　　⑤ 资金用于…funds are used to…
　　这里要注意“用于”暗含了被动的含义。要清楚be used to do sth和be used to doing sth 以及used to do sth。的区别。
　　⑥ 使16万多所中小学受益
　　….benefiting more than 160,000 primary and secondary schools。
　　这里可以用现在分词作伴随状语，还可以用 to make ….beneficial来表达。
　　⑦ 为接受更好教育而转往城市上学的学生
　　students who has transferred to city schools to receive a better education
　　“为接受更好教育而转往城市上学”这个比较长的定语，可以处理成定语从句，同时还可以用分词短语作后置定语来表达，即students transferred to city schools to receive a better education。
　　
　　【翻译译文】：In order to promote equity in education, China has invested 36 billion yuan for the improvement of educational facilities in rural areas and strengthening of rural compulsory education Midwest.

　　翻译题目二：中国应进一步发展核能，因为核电目前只占其总发电量的2%，该比例在所有核国家中居第30位，几乎是最低的。2011年3月日本核电站事故后，中国的核能开发停了下来，中止审批新的核电站，并开展全国性的核安全检查。到2012年10月，审批才能又谨慎的恢复。随着技术和安全措施的改进，发生核事故的可能性完全可以降低到最低限度。换句话说核能是可以安全开发和利用的。
　　
　　词汇考点： 	
　　核能：nuclear power?
　　(中国)总发电量；the total amount of electricity produced in China
　　占（比例）：take up
　　居（位）rank No.. among..
　　核电站：nuclear power station
　　审批权：the examination and approval authority
　　谨慎地：with caution
　　恢复：resume
　　安全措施：safety measures
　　语法考点： 被动语态 
　　
　　【翻译译文】
　　China should further develop nuclear energy because nuclear power accounts for only 2% of its total generating capacity currently. Such proportion ranks the thirtieth in all the countries possessing nuclear power, which is almost the last.
　　After Japan’s nuclear power accident in March 2011, nuclear power development in China was suspended, so was the approval of new nuclear power plants. Also, the national safety check for the nuclear power was carried out. IT was not until October 2012 that the approval was prudently resumed. 
　　With the improvement of technology and safety measures, there is little possibility for nuclear accidents to happen. In other words, there won’t be any trouble to develop and exploit the nuclear power. 
　　
　　翻译题目三：中国教育工作者早就认识到读书对于国家的重要意义，有些教育工作者2003年就建议设立全民读书日。他们强调，人们应当读好书，尤其是经典著作。通过阅读，人们能更好地学会感恩、有责任心和与人合作，而教育的目的正是要培养这些基本素质，阅读对于中小学生尤为重要，假如他们没有这个关键时期培养阅读的兴趣，以后要养成阅读的习惯就很难了。
　　
　　【翻译译文】Chinese education workers have already realized the significance of reading for a nation. Some workers suggested that we should have a national reading day in 2003. They emphasized that people should read good books especially the classical ones. Through reading, people can learn better how to be grateful, responsible and cooperative. The goal of education is to cultivate these basic personalities. Reading is especially important for middle and primary school students. Suppose they don't nurture the interest of reading at that key moment, it will be harder to develop a habit to read books. 
　　
　　点评：翻译部分的难度比2013年的考试是有所变化的，具体表现为：考试重心转向于中国文化和社会发展——中国教育公平，培养读书习惯和核能的开发。翻译与作文对于句型的应用是一样的，但词汇方面则要注意“语内翻译”方法的应用，把原文中的陌生词汇转化为熟知词汇，应用起来得心应手。

[H]?Precisely.?The?risks?of?eating?too?much?fat?or?salt?(which?are?very?different)?pale?intoinsignificant?compared?with?the?harm?done?by?sugar.?And?it?is?everywhere.

Stunt people (替身演员) are not movie stars, but they are the hidden heroes of many movies.
They were around long before films. Even Shakespeare may have used them in fight scenes. To be good, a fight scene has to look real. Punches must __26__ enemies'jaws. Sword fights must be fought with __27__ swords. Several actors arc usually in a fight scene. Their moves must be set up so that no one gets hurt. It is almost like planning a dance performance.
If a movie scene is dangerous, stunt people usually __28__ the stars. You may think you see Tom Cruise running along the top of a train. But it is __29__ his stunt double. Stunt people must __30__ the stars they stand in for. Their height and build should be about the same. But when close-ups are needed, the film __31__ the star. Some stunt people __32__ in certain kinds of scenes. For instance, a stunt woman named Jan Davis does all kinds of jumps. She has leapt from planes and even off the top of a waterfall. Each jump required careful planning and expert __33__.
Yakima Canutt was a famous cowboy stunt man. Among other stunts, he could jump from a second story window onto a horse's back. He __34__ the famous trick of sliding under a moving stagecoach. Canutt also __35__ a new way to make a punch look real. He was the only stunt man ever to get an Oscar.

One principle of taxation, called the benefit principle, states that people should pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from government services. This principle tries to make public goods similar to __36__ goods. It seems reasonable that a person who often goes to the movies pays more in __37__ for movie tickets than a person who rarely goes. And __38__ a person who gets great benefit from a public good should pay more for it than a person who gets little benefit.
The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes __39__ using the benefits principle. In some states, __40__ from the gasoline tax are used to build and maintain roads. Because those who buy gasoline are the same people who use the roads, the gasoline tax might be viewed as a __41__ way to pay this government service.
The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should pay higher taxes than poorer ones, __42__ because the wealthy benefit more from public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection from __43__. Citizens with much to protect get greater benefit from police than those with less to protect.

Growing Up Colored

[A] You wouldn't know Piedmont anymore—my Piedmont, I mean—the town in West Virginia where I learned to be a colored boy.
[B] The 1950s in Piedmont was a time to remember, or at least to me. People were always proud to be from Piedmont—lying at the foot of a mountain, on the banks of the mighty Potomac. We knew God gave America no more beautiful location. I never knew colored people anywhere who were crazier about mountains and water, flowers and trees, fishing and hunting. For as long as anyone could remember, we could outhunt, outshoot, and outswim the white boys in the valley.
[C] The social structure of Piedmont was something we knew like the back of our hands. It was an immigrant town; white Piedmont was Italian and Irish, with a handful of wealthy WASPs (盎格鲁撒克逊裔的白人新教徒) on East Hampshire Street, and "ethnic" neighborhoods of working-class people everywhere else, colored and white.
[D] For as long as anyone can remember, Piedmont's character has been completely bound up with the Westvaco paper mill: its prosperous past and doubtful future. At first glance, the town is a typical dying mill center. Many once beautiful buildings stand empty, evidencing a bygone time of spirit and pride. The big houses on East Hampshire Street are no longer proud, as they were when I cet4v.com
[E] Like the Italians and the Irish, most of the colored people migrated to Piedmont at the turn of the 20th century to work at the paper mill, which opened in 1888. All the colored men at the paper mill worked on "the platform"—loading paper into trucks until the craft unions were finally integrated in 1968. Loading is what Daddy did every working day of his life. That's what almost every colored grown-up I knew did.
[F] Colored people lived in three neighborhoods that were clearly separated. Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said. And it felt good in there, like walking around your house in bare feet and underwear, or snoring right out loud on the couch in front of the TV—enveloped by the comforts of home, the warmth of those you love.
[G] Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence. And though our own world was seemingly self-contained, it impacted on the white world of Piedmont in almost every direction. Certainly, the borders of our world seemed to be impacted on when some white man or woman showed up where he or she did not belong, such as at the black Legion Hall. Our space was violated when one of them showed up at a dance or a party. The rhythms would be off. The music would sound not quite right: attempts to pat the beat off just so. Everybody would leave early.
[H] Before 1955, most white people were just shadowy presences in our world, vague figures of power like remote bosses at the mill or tellers at the bank. There were exceptions, of course, the white people who would come into our world in ritualized, everyday ways we all understood. Mr. Mail Man, Mr. Insurance Man, Mr. White-and-Chocolate Milk Man, Mr. Landlord Man, Mr. Police Man: we called white people by their trade, like characters in a mystery play. Mr. Insurance Man would come by every other week to collect premiums on college or death policies, sometimes 50 cents or less.
[I] "It's no disgrace to be colored," the black entertainer Bert Williams famously observed early in the century, "but it is awfully inconvenient." For most of my childhood, we couldn't cat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores. Mama insisted that we dress up when we went to shop. She was carefully dressed when she went to clothing stores, and wore white pads called shields under her arms so her dress or blouse would show no sweat. "We'd like to try this on," she'd say carefully, uttering her words precisely and properly. "We don't buy clothes we can't try on," she'd say when they declined, and we'd walk out in Mama's dignified (有尊严的) manner. She preferred to shop where we had an account and where everyone knew who she was.
[J] At the Cut-Rate Drug Store, no one colored was allowed to sit down at the counter or tables, with one exception: my father. I don't know for certain why Carl Dadisman, the owner, wouldn't stop Daddy from sitting down. But I believe it was in part because Daddy was so light-colored, and in part because, during his shift at the phone company, he picked up orders for food and coffee for the operators. Colored people were supposed to stand at the counter, get their food to go, and leave. Even when Young Doc Bess would set up the basketball team with free Cokes after one of many victories, the colored players had to stand around and drink out of paper cups while the white players and cheerleaders sat down in comfortable chairs and drank out of glasses.
[K] I couldn't have been much older than five or six as I sat with my father at the Cut-Rate one afternoon, enjoying two scoops of caramel ice cream. Mr. Wilson, a stony-faced, brooding Irishman, walked by.
"Hello, Mr. Wilson," my father said.
"Hello, George."
[L] I was genuinely puzzled. Mr. Wilson must have confused my father with somebody else, but who? There weren't any Georges among the colored people in Piedmont. "Why don't you tell him your name, Daddy?" I asked loudly. "Your name isn't George."
"He knows my name, boy," my father said after a long pause. "He calls all colored people George."
[M] I knew we wouldn't talk about it again; even at that age, 1 was given to understand that there were some subjects it didn't do to worry to death about. Now that I have children, I realize that what distressed my father wasn't so much the Mr. Wilsons of the world as the painful obligation to explain the racial facts of life to someone who hadn't quite learned them yet. Maybe Mr. Wilson couldn't hurt my father by calling him George; but I hurt him by asking to know why.

　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

Children are a delight. They are our future. But sadly, hiring someone to take care of them while you go to work is getting more expensive by the year.
Earlier this month, it was reported that the cost of enrolling an infant or small kid at a childcare center rose 3% in 2012, faster than the overall cost of living. There are now large strips of the country where daycare for an infant costs more than a tenth of the average married couple's income.
This is not necessarily a new trend, but it is a somewhat puzzling one. The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers make less today, in real terms, than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for up to 80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would expect flat wages to have meant flat prices.
So who's to blame for higher childcare costs?
Childcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child, and other minute details. And the stricter the regulations, the higher the costs. If it has to hire a caregiver for every two children, it can't really achieve any economies of scale on labor to save money when other expenses go up. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.
Unfortunately, I don't have all the daycare-center regulations handy. But I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more elaborate, prices have risen. The tradeoff (交换) might be worth it in some cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least cet4v.com.

56. What problem do parents of small kids have to face?
A) The ever-rising childcare prices.
B) The budgeting of family expenses.
C) The balance between work and family.
D) The selection of a good daycare center.

57. What does the author feel puzzled about?
A) Why the prices of childcare vary greatly from state to state.
B) Why increased childcare prices have not led to better service.
C) Why childcare workers' pay has not increased with the rising childcare costs.
D) Why there is a severe shortage of childcare professional in a number of states.

58. What prevent childcare centers from saving money?
A) Steady increase in labor costs.
B) Strict government regulations.
C) Lack of support from the state.
D) High administrative expenses.

59. Why is the average cost of childcare in Mississippi much lower than in Massachusetts?
A) The overall quality of service is not as good.
B) Payments for caregivers there are not as high.
C) Living expenses there are comparatively low.
D) Each teacher is allowed to care for more kids.

60. What is the author's view on daycare service?
A) Caregivers should receive regular professional training.
B) Less elaborate rules about childcare might lower costs.
C) It is crucial to strike a balance between quality and costs.
D) It is better for different states to learn from each other.


Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

Alex Pang's amusing new book The Distraction Addiction addresses those of us who feel panic without a cellphone or computer. And that, he claims, is pretty much all of us. When we're not online, where we spend four months annually, we're engaged in the stressful work of trying to get online.
The Distraction Addiction is not framed as a self-help book. It's a thoughtful examination of the danger of our computing overdose and a historical overview of how technological advances change consciousness. A "professional futurist", Pang urges an approach which he calls "contemplative (沉思的) computing." He asks that you pay full attention to "how your mind and body interact with computers and how your attention and creativity are influenced by technology."
Pang's first job is to free you from common misconception that doing two things at once allows you to get more done. What is commonly called multitasking is, in fact, switch-tasking, and its harmful effects on productivity are well documented. Pang doesn't advocate returning to a preinternet world. Instead, he asks you to "take a more ecological (生态的) view of your relationships with technologies and look for ways devices or media may be making specific tasks easier or faster but at the same time making your work and life harder."
The Distraction Addiction is particularly fascinating on how technologies have changed certain field of labor—often for the worse. For architects, computer-aided design has become essential but in some ways has cheapened the design process. As one architect puts it, "Architecture is first and foremost about thinking... and drawing is a more productive way of thinking" than computer-aided design. Somewhat less amusing are Pang's solutions for kicking the Internet habit. He recommends the usual behavior-modification approaches, familiar to anyone who has completed a quit-smoking program. Keep logs to study your online profile and decide what you can knock out, download a program like Freedom that locks you out of your browser, or take a "digital Sabbath (安息日)" ; "Unless you're a reporter or emergency-department doctor, you'll discover that your world doesn't fall apart when you go offline."

61. Alex Pang's new book is aimed for readers who ________.
A) find their work online too stressful
B) go online mainly for entertainment
C) are fearful about using the cellphone or computer
D) can hardly tear themselves away from the Internet

62. What does Alex Pang try to do in his new book?
A) Offer advice on how to use the Internet effectively.
B) Warn people of the possible dangers of Internet use.
C) Predict the trend of future technological development.
D) Examine the influence of technology on the human mind.

63. What is the common view on multitasking?
A) It enables people to work more efficiently.
B) It is in a way quite similar to switch-tasking.
C) It makes people's work and life even harder.
D) It distracts people's attention from useful work.

64. What does the author think of computer-aided design?
A) It considerably cuts down the cost of building design.
B) It somewhat restrains architects' productive thinking.
C) It is indispensable in architects' work process.
D) It can free architects from laborious drawing.

65. What is Ales Pang's recommendation for Internet users?
A) They use the Internet as little as possible.
B) They keep a record of their computer time.
C) They exercise self-control over their time online.
D) They entertain themselves online on off-days only.

Part Ⅰ Writing
A Campus Activity that Benefited Me Most

University provides many interesting activities to enrich our life on campus. In the past two years, I attended a couple of student societies such as mountain-climbing club and literature society. The most beneficial activity I participated is attending English Comer.
First, attending English Comer offers a great opportunity to draw my attention away from busy studies so that 1 can relax, since the Comer is held in a square. As a college student, most of my time is killed in the classroom and library. At the Corner, I can talk in English with my peers on topics of our interest, so it's a relaxation in tedious school life.
Second, joining English Corner significantly improved my oral English as well as English listening comprehension. It's the most efficient way for me to practice spoken English because mine is far better now than before.
Third, it is a terrific way of socializing. I can get to know unacquainted students, and make friends with them.
Therefore, it is safe to conclude that, attending English Corner has benefited me most among campus activities.

　　The?Changes?Facing?Fast?Food
　　A)Fast-food?firms?have?to?be?a?thick-skinned?bunch.Health?experts?regularly?criticise?themseverelyfor?selling?food?that?makes?people?fat.Critics?even?complain?that?McDonald's,?whoselogosymbolises?calorie?excess,?should?not?have?been?allowed?to?sponsor?the?World?Cup.Thesearethings?fast-food?firms?have?learnt?to?cope?with.But?not?perhaps?for?much?longer.Theburgerbusiness?faces?more?pressure?from?regulators?at?a?time?when?it?is?already?adaptingstrategies?inresponse?to?shifts?in?the?global?economy.
　　B)Fast?food?was?once?thought?to?be?recession-proof.When?consumers?need?to?cut?spending,the?logicgoes,?cheap?meals?like?Big?Macs?and?Whoppers?become?even?more?attractive.Such"trading?down"proved?true?for?much?of?the?latest?recession,?when?fast-food?companies?picked?upcustomers?who?could?no?longer?afford?to?eat?at?casual?restaurants.Traffic?was?boosted?inAmerica,?the?home?of?fast?food,?with?discounts?and?promotions,?such?as?$1?menus?and?cheapcombination?meals.
　　C)As?a?result,?fast-food?chains?have?weathered?the?recession?better?than?their?moreexpensive?competitors.In?2009?sales?at?full-service?restaurants?in?America?fell?by?more?than?6% ,?but?total?sales?remained?about?the?same?at?fast-food?chains.In?some?markets,?such?as?Japan,France?and?Britain,?total?spending?on?fast?food?increased.Same-store?sales?in?America?atMcDonald's,?the?world's?largest?fast-food?company,?did?not?decline?throughout?thedownturn.Panera?Bread,?an?American?fast-food?chain?known?for?its?fresh?ingredients,?performedwell,?too,?because?it?offers?higher-quality?food?at?lower?prices?than?restaurants.
　　D)But?not?all?fast-food?companies?have?been?as?fortunate.Many,?such?as?Burger?King,?haveseen?sales?fall.In?a?severe?recession,?while?some?people?trade?down?to?fast?food,?many?otherseat?at?home?more?frequently?to?save?money.David?Palmer,?an?analyst?at?UBS,?a?bank,?sayssmaller?fast-?food?chains?in?America,?such?as?Jack?in?the?Box?and?Carl's?Jr.,?have?been?hitparticularly?hard?in?this?downturn?because?they?are?competing?with?the?global?giantMcDonald's,?which?increased?spending?on?advertising?by?more?than?7%?last?year?as?others?cutback.
　　E)Some?fast-food?companies?also?sacrificed?their?own?profits?by?trying?to?give?customersbetter?value.During?the?recession?companies?set?prices?low,?hoping?that?once?they?had?temptedcustomers?through?the?door?they?would?be?persuaded?to?order?more?expensive?items.But?inmany?cases?that?strategy?did?not?work.Last?year?Burger?King?franchisees?(特许经营人)sued?(起诉)the?company?over?its?double-cheeseburger?promotion,?claiming?it?was?unfair?for?them?to?berepuired?to?sell?these?for?$1?when?they?cost$1.10?to?make.In?May?a?judge?ruled?in?favour?ofBurger?King.Nevertheless,?the?company?may?still?be?cursing?its?decision?to?promote?cheapchoices?over?more?expensive?ones?because?items?on?its?"value?menu"?now?account?for?around20%?of?all?sales,?upfrom?12%?last?October.
　　F)Analysts?expect?the?fast-food?industry?to?grow?modestly?this?year.But?the?downturn?ismakingcompanies?rethink?their?strategies.Many?are?now?introducing?higher-priced?items?toentice?(引诱)consumers?away?from?$1?specials.KFC,?a?division?of?Yum!?Brands,?which?also?ownsTaco?Belland?Pizza?Hut,?has?launched?a?chicken?sandwich?that?costs?around?$5.And?in?MayBurger?Kingintroduced?barbecue?(烧烤)pork?ribs?at?$7?for?eight.
　　G)Companies?are?also?trying?to?get?customers?to?buy?new?and?more?items,?includingdrinks.McDonald's?started?selling?better?coffee?as?a?challenge?to?Starbucks.Its?"?McCafe"?linenowaccounts?for?an?estimated?6%?of?sales?in?America.Starbucks?has?sold?rights?to?its?Seattle'sBestcoffee?brand?to?Burger?King,?which?will?start?selling?it?later?this?year.
　　H)As?fast-food?companies?shift?from?"super?size"?to?"more?buys",?they?need?to?keepcustomer?traffichigh?throughout?the?day.Many?see?breakfast?as?a?big?opporttmity,?and?not?justfor?fatty?food.McDonald's?will?start?selling?porridge?(粥)in?America?next?year.Breakfast?has?thepotential?to?bevery?profitable,?says?Sara?Senatore?of?Bernstein,?a?research?firm,?because?themargins?can?be?high.Fast-food?companies?are?also?adding?midday?and?late-night?snacks,?such?asblended?drinks?andwraps.The?idea?is?that?by?having?a?greater?range?of?things?on?the?menu, "wecan?sell?to?consumersproducts?they?want?all?day,"?says?Rick?Carucci.,?the?.chief?financial?officerof?Yum?!?Brands.
　　I)But?what?about?those?growing?waistlines??So?far,?fast-food?firms?have?cleverly?avoidedgovernmentregulation.By?providing?healthy?options,?like?salads?and?low-calorie?sandwiches,they?have?at?leastgiven?the?impression?of?doing?something?about?helping?to?fight?obesity?(肥胖症).These?offeringsare?not?necessarily?loss-leaders,?as?they?broaden?the?appeal?of?outlets?togroups?of?diners?thatinclude?some?people?who?don't?want?to?eat?a?burger.But?customers?cannotbe?forced?to?ordersalads?instead?of?fries.
　　J)In?the?future,?simply?offering?a?healthy?option?may?not?be?good?enough."Every?packaged-food?and?restaurant?company?I?know?is?concerned?about?regulation?right?now,"?saysMr.Palmer?of?UBS.America's?health-reform?bill,?which?Congress?passed?this?year,?requiresrestaurant?chains?with?20?ormore?outlets?to?put?the?calorie-content?of?items?they?serve?on?themenu.A?study?by?the?NationalBureau?of?Economic?Research,?which?tracked?the?effects?onStarbucks?of?a?similar?calorie-postinglaw?in?New?York?City?in?2007,?found?that?the?averagecalorie-count?per?transaction?fell?6%?andrevenue?increased?3%?at?Starbucks?stores?where?aDunldn?Donuts?outlet?was?nearby--a?sign,?it?issaid,?that?menu-labelling?could?favour?chainsthat?have?more?healthy?offerings.
　　K)In?order?to?avoid?other?legislation?in?America?and?elsewhere,?fast-food?companies?willhave?tocontinue?innovating?(创新).Walt?Riker?of?McDonald's?claims?the?change?it?has?made?in?itsmenumeans?it?offers?more?healthy?items?than?it?did?a?few?years?ago."We?probably?sell?morevegetables,more?milk,?more?salads,?more?apples?than?any?restaurant?business?in?the?world,"?hesays.But?therecent?proposal?by?a?county?in?California?to?ban?McDonald's?from?including?toys?inits?high-calorie"Happy?Meals",?because?legislators?believe?it?attracts?children?to?unhealthyfood,?suggests?there?isa?lot?more?left?to?do.

　　Passage?One
　　Questions?56?to?60?are?based?on?the?following?passage.
　　If?you?think?a?high-factor?sunscreen?(防晒霜)keeps?you?safe?from?harmful?rays,?you?may?bewrong.Research?in?this?week's?Nature?shows?that?while?factor?50?reduces?the?number?ofmelanomas(黑瘤)and?delays?their?occurrence,?it?can't?prevent?them.Melanomas?are?the?mostaggressive?skin?cancers.You?have?a?higher?risk?if?you?have?red?or?blond?hair,?fair?skin,?blue?orgreen?eyes,?or?sunburn?easily,?or?if?a?close?relative?has?had?one.Melanomas?are?more?common?ifyou?have?periodic?intense?exposure?to?the?sun.Other?skin?cancers?are?increasingly?likely?withlong-term?exposure.
　　There?is?continuing?debate?as?to?how?effective?sunscreen?is?in?reducing?melanomas?theevidence?is?weaker?than?it?is?for?preventing?other?types?of?skin?cancer.A?2011?Australian?studyof?1,621?people?found?that?people?randomly?selected?to?apply?sunscreen?daily?had?half?the?rateof?melanomas?of?people?who?used?cream?as?needed.A?second?study,?comparing?1,167?peoplewith?melanomas?to?1,101?who?didn't?have?the?cancer,?found?that?using?sunscreen?routinely,alongside?other?protection?such?as?hats,long?sleeves?or?staying?in?the?shade,?did?give?someprotection.This?study?said?other?forms?of?sun?protection?not?sunscreen?seemed?mostbeneficial.The?study?relied?on?people?remembering?what?they?had?done?over?each?decade?oftheir?lives,?so?it's?not?entirely?reliable.But?it?seems?reasonable?to?think?sunscreen?givespeople?a?false?sense?of?security?in?the?sun.
　　Many?people?also?don't?use?sunscreen?properly?applying?insufficient?amounts,?failing?toreapply?after?a?couple?of?hours?and?staying?in?the?sun?too?long.It?is?sunburn?that?is?mostworrying?recent?research?shows?five?episodes?of?sunburn?in?the?teenage?years?increases?the?riskof?all?skin?cancers.
The?good?news?is?that?a?combination?of?sunscreen?and?covering?up?can?reduce?melanomarates,?as?shown?by?Australian?figures?from?their?slip-slop-slap?campaign.So?if?there?is?a?heatwave?this?summer,?it?would?be?best?for?us,?too,?to?slip?on?a?shirt,?slop?on?(抹上)sunscreen?andslap?on?a?hat.

C.It?is?ineffective?with?long-term?exposure.
D.It?is?ineffective?for?people?with?fair?skin.

参考答案与解析

    1.D)。选项中多次出现game和play?chess，可以推测对话内容与下象棋有关。另外，从四个选项的内容审可以椎测，对话讲的府该县女士想放弃下象棋，男士给出建议或指导。
　　本题的关键在于听懂反问句和反问的语调。女士说因为今天又输了，所以打算放弃下象棋。男士没有正面回应，而是反问了两句：Just?because?you?lost?Is?that?any?reaSon?to?quit?”仅仅是因为输了吗?那能算是放弃的理由吗?”言外之意就是不该放弃。换句话说就是，男士建议女士继续下棋。故本题答案为D)。
　　2.C)。选项中出现了mail，address和contact等词，可以推测对话内容和邮件有关：由选项中的玛丽和萨利两个人名可知对话的内容涉及另外两个人，人物较多，听录音时应注意区分人物之间的关系，做好标记；另外，选项A)以the?mail作主语，选项B)和D)以she作主语，可以推测该题会从女士的角度提问，女士的话为听音重点。
　　本题的关键在于听到细节“Mary?should?know?it.”男士想把萨利的邮件转寄给她，问女士是否知道她的地址。女士说自己很久没跟萨利联系了，但是结尾补充了一句：“玛丽应该知道地址。”故本题答案为C)。
　　3．B)。选项中出现了handwriting，notes和class等词，可以推测对话内容应该与上课做笔记有关。另外，四个选项中，A)和B)以his开头，C)和D)以he为主语，可以推测该题会从男士的角度提问，男士的话为听音重点。
　　解题的关键是听懂反意疑问句。女士想要借男士的笔记看，男士没有正面回答，而是反问道：You'venever?seen?my?handwriting，have?you?“你没看过我的笔迹，对吗?”言外之意就是自己的笔迹难以辨认，不易读懂。故本题答案为B)。
　　4.A)。四个选项中反复出现了choose和restaurant等词，由此推测对话内容与选择饭店有关。另外，选项A)和D)均是讲男士选择饭店，而选项B)和C)则出现了dating和her，故可推测该题可能是从女士的角度看待男士所选择的饭店，女士的话为听音重点。男士说今晚要带女朋友去新开的饭店过生日。女士说她上周去过，太让她失望了。从rather?disaDpointing可以听出女士话语中强烈的否定意味，言外之意就是建议男士不要去这家饭店了，应该另选一家。故本题答案为A)。
　　5.A)。四个选项中三个都提到了季节，由此推测对话内容可能与季节有关。另外，四个选项都是以he开头，故可判断该题会从男士的角度进行提问，男士的话为听音重点。
女士说，冬天终于结束了，可以把手套和靴子收起来了。男士回应说为此他已经等了好几个月了。显然男士和女士一样非常期待冬天的结束，也就是盼望春天的到来。故本题答案为A)。
　　6.B).四个选项中，A)和D)以the?woman为主语，B)和C)以the?man为主语，选项在内容上较分散，可以推测该题并非针对男士或女士个人的话提问，而是考查对整个对话的理解，听音时应注意从全局把握对话内容。
对话开头，女士对男士说，谢谢他把书送回来，由此可知应该是男士借了女士的书，故首先排除C)项：男士说，他认为女士周末会用到，而且感谢女士让他使用这些书，故本题选择B)。
　　7.A)。选项中涉及work，on?foot，trip和walk等词，可推测对话和步行上班或旅行相关。四个选项均为动词短语，由此可推断该题会对建议或计划进行提问，应特别注意和建议或计划相关的表述。
女士问男士的工作时间是否可以变通，男士回答说，不能。但今天天气很好，他决定步行去上班。所以必须比平常早一个小时出发。男士话语中有明显的表示计划的动词decided，其后的内容就是本题的答案，故答案为A)。
　　8.C)。四个选项均涉及飞机和机场，而且都和机场存在的问题有关，故听音的重点为机场在哪方面出现了问题。
　　9.D)。由对话开头可知，男士在给女士打电话，女士问男士有什么事情，男士在说明来电目的前说，自己了解到女士的公司有家化学加工厂，故D)为答案。
　　10.C)。对话中，男士先表明自己的身份，介绍了自己公司，说明了来电目的是想和格兰德先生讨论如何帮助TGC公司防止泄漏，同时节省开支的问题，实际上就是要推荐自己公司的产品，由此可推断男士是一名销售员，故C)为答案。
　　11.B)。对话中，女士告知男士格兰德先生非常忙，没空与男士说话，男士想找其他人商谈，女士告诉他，他正和格兰德先生的私人助理说话，即女士就是格兰德先生的私人助理，故B)为答案。
　　12.C)。对话中，女士说let?me?suggest?Something，由此可知，其后就是女士对男士的建议，即为该题的答案。对话中，女士建议男士将其公司产品和服务的详情以及其他公司的推荐信一并寄送过来，之后会和男士联系，故C)为答案。

　　13.D)。男士问女士是否想过会在西方世界生活和工作，女士回答说没有，但是自己一直都听欧洲大型管弦乐队的唱片，由此可知女士在到欧洲之前听过很多欧洲管弦乐队的唱片，故D)是答案。
　　14.A)。男士问女士是否很小就喜欢古典音乐，女士给出肯定回答，并说自己六岁就开始在学校学习小提琴，故A)为答案。
　　15.B)。对话末尾，女士提到自己十五岁获得奖学金到巴黎留学，男士询问女士父母对此有何感受，女士说她父母喜忧参半，因为这既是个千载难逢的机会，也意味着她要远离故乡。四个选项中只有B)与原文相符，故为答案。

　　16.D)。短文中作者先提出“有多少人了解莎士比亚本人”的问题，接着指出学者们经过几个世纪的研究之后，仍然在不断探索他的个人史。由此可知，莎士比亚的个人史很少有人知道，故D)为答案。
　　17.C)。本题考查对莎士比亚父亲的了解，由于使用的人称代词都是he，会对听前预测造成一定的干扰，在听录音时应注意将选项和短文内容进行匹配区别。文章中提到莎士比亚的父亲受人尊敬，是埃文河畔斯特拉特福镇议会的一名成员，故C)为答案。
　　18.B)。文章中提到1666年伦敦的一场大火把很多重要文件烧毁了，而这些本来可能是了解莎士比亚的线索，因此莎士比亚的一部分生活将永远不为人所知，故B)为答案。

　　19.A)。短文开头部分提到，人们在外出旅游时遇到的大部分人都是既友好又热情的，但也会遇到很多危险，而其中最为常见的就是盗窃，故A)为答案。
　　20.D)。文中提到，在准备出国旅游时，一定要确保文件正确，谁都不想到了目的地却发现签证错误、护照过期等情况。选项D)中的documents与文中的paperwork是同义转述，故D)为答案。
　　21.C)。文章最后给出建议：到达目的地后要选择乘坐正规的交通工具，故C)为答案。

　　22.B)。短文提到，拉特纳在1984年接管了父亲的珠宝连锁店后，决定以最低的价格卖出低档产品，选项B)中sell?inexpensive?products是原文sell?downmarket?products的同义转述，故B)为答案。
　　23.D)。短文明确提到，在一次英国上层商人会议上，拉特纳出席并解释了自己成功的秘密，故D)为答案。
　　24.A)。短文提到，听到拉特纳的评论后，人们觉得受到了侮辱并远离拉特纳的商店，故A)为答案。
　　25.C)。短文开头就点明了主题，提到英国人以自嘲闻名，但即使是对他们来说，幽默也应该有限度，接着短文以拉特纳的故事为例说明这个主题，文末再次强调“这个玩笑的代价太大了”，以此首尾呼应，告诉我们开玩笑要有度，故C)为答案。

　　26.prospering。此处应该填人一个现在分词或形容词，作is的表语。prospering意为“繁荣的”。
　　27.decade。此处应该填入表示时间的名词，与前面的介词during搭配。decade意为“十年”。
　　28.opposite。此处应该填入名词。opposite意为“对立面”。
　　29.sustain。此处应该填入动词原形作从句谓语，上文的先行词reSource?uses充当其主语。sustain意为“保持，维持”。
　　30.In?simple?terms。此处应该填入副词或介词短语作状语。in?simple?terms意为“简言之”。
　　31.establish。此处应该填入动词原形，与其前面的help搭配，并且能和后面的way搭配。estabfish意为“建立，设立”。
　　32.reaSonably。此处应该填入副词修饰well。reaSonably意为“尚可，还可以”。
　　33.take?into?account。此处应该填入动词原形或动词短语。take?into?account意为“考虑，重视”。
　　34.misleading。此处应该填入形容词来修饰sense。misleading意为“令人误解的”。
　　35.using?up。此处应该填人动名词或动名词短语来作介词for的宾语，并和forests进行搭配。usingup意为“耗尽，用光”。

　　36.A)announcing。动词辨析题。句首出现时间状语today，空格位于系动词is和名词短语thelaunchof…之间，因此空格处需要填人动词的现在分词形式，构成现在进行时。前一句提到，美国教育部正在努力确保所有学生享有接受高质量教育的平等权利。因此，空格处需要填人一个能够与名词launch构成动宾搭配的动词，表示“宣布开始实施一项方案或活动”。由此确定announcing为本题答案，意思是“宣布”。备选词中，distributing意思是“分发，散布”，与此处文意不符，且无法与launch构成动宾搭配，故排除。
　　37.K)entitled。动词辨析题。空格前面是系动词are，后面是介词to及其宾语，因此空格处需要填入形容词作表语或者动词的被动语态，并与介词to搭配。上文提到，美国教育部今天宣布开始实施为所有学生提供优秀教育工作者的活动方案，本句解释了实施此方案的原因，即所有孩子都应有权利接受高质量的教育。因此，空格处需要填人一个表示“有权利”或“有资格”的形容词，且能够与介词to搭配，备选形容词中只有entitled同时符合这两项要求，由此确定其为本题答案。be?entitled?to意思是“有……资格”。备选词中，beneficial意思是“有利的，有益的”，与此处文意不符，排除；qualified意思是“有资格的”，但不能与介词to
搭配使用，因此也可以排除。
　　38.G)critically。副词辨析题。空格前面是系动词is，后面是形容词important，因此空格处需要填入一个副词，用来修饰形容词important。上句提到，所有的孩子，不分种族、居住地及家庭收入，都应有权利接受高质量的教育，本句承接上句，表明为教师和校长们提供帮助学生发挥全部潜力所需支持的重要性。因此，空格处需要填入一个表示“非常，相当，很”的副词，与important表达“至关重要”的意义，由此确定副词critically为本题答案，意思是“很大程度上，极为重要地”。备选词中，properly意思是“合理地，正确地”，与此处文意不符，因此可以排除。
　　39.L)potential。名词辨析题。空格前面为形容词性物主代词their及形容词hill，因此空格处需要填人一个名词。本句提到要为教师和校长们提供支持，而这些支持是为了帮助学生发挥其全部潜力。因此，空格处需要填入一个能与动词reach相搭配的名词，且表达“潜力，能力”的意义，由此确定名词potential为本题答案，意思是“潜力”。备选词中，challenges意思是“挑战”，commitment意思是“投入，承诺”，component意思是“组成部分，部件”，contests意思是“比赛”，均与此处文意不符，且不能与动词reach搭配，可以排除。
　　40.D)commitment。名词辨析题。空格前面为形容词deep，后面为介词of，因此空格处需要填人名词。根据连词and可以判断，该名词与and前面的excellentwork在意义上应该是并列的，且根据上下文，此处要表达的意义是教师和校长们工作出色且努力。因此，空格处的名词表达的是“努力”或“投入”的意思，且为不可数的抽象名词，备选词中只有commitment一词符合要求，由此确定其为本题答案。备选词中的challenges和contests均为可数名词复数形式，可以排除；component意思是“组成部分，部件”，与此处文意不符，且不能用deep进行修饰，可以排除；potential已经用过，直接排除。
　　41.H)develop。动词辨析题。空格前面为助动词will，后面为名词短语their?own?creativeSolutions，因此空格处需要填入动词原形，与will构成一般将来时态，并与名词Solutions构成动宾短语。Solutions意思是“解决方案”，因此填入的动词应该表达“想出，找到”或“研究出，制定出”的意义。由此可以确定，动词develop为本题答案，意思是“形成”。备选词中，enhance意思是“增强，提高”，retain意思是“留用”，均不能与Solutions搭配，且与此处文意不符，因此可以排除。
　　42.J)enhance。动词辨析题。空格前面是动词短语work?together及动词不定式符号to，后面是名词短语our?focus，因此空格处需要填入动词原形，且与Our?focus构成动宾搭配。根据上下文，教育部长认为我们必须共同努力增强对于某些问题的关注。因此，空格处填人的动词应该表达“增强，增加”的意义，由此可以确定，动词enhance为本题答案，意思是“增强，提高”。备选词中，develop已经用过，直接排除；retain意思是“留用”，与此处文意不符，也可以排除。
　　43.O)retain。动词辨析题。根据and前面的两个动词recruit和support及其形式可以判断，空格处需要填入的是动词原形，且与recruit和support构成并列关系，recruit意思是“招募”，support意思是“支持，配备”，宾语都是空格后的effective?teachers?and?principals，由此可以确定，动词retain为本题答案。
　　44.E)component。名词辨析题。空格前面是不定冠词a，后面是介词of，因此空格处需要填入可数名词的单数形式。前面讲到，今天的公告是改善获得高质量教育权利的又一重要步骤，而介词of后面又提到了奥巴马总统行动年，因此可以判断今天的公告内容是奥巴马总统行动年的行动内容之一，空格处应填入表示“内容，组成部分”的名词。由此可以确定名词component为本题答案，意思是“组成部分”。备选词中，commitment和potential已经用过，直接排除；challenges和contests均为可数名词的复数形式，也可以排除。
　　45.C)challenges。名词辨析题。空格前面是定冠词the，后面是介词of，因此空格处应填入名词形式。本句介绍的是邓肯部长将带领召开与来自全国各地的校长和学校教师展开的圆桌会议内容，根据上下文，在高需求的学校工作必将面临更多的挑战或困难。因此，空格处填入的名词可能表达“困难，问题”或“挑战”的意义，由此可以判断，名词challenges为本题答案，意思是“挑战”。备选词中，commitment，potential和component均用过，直接排除；contests意思是“比赛”，与此处文意不符，也可以排除。

　　56.B)推理判断题。文章开篇即指出，如果你认为高指数的防晒霜能够使你免遭有害射线的辐射，那你可能就错了。由此可见，对于防晒霜能够保护皮肤不受伤害的这种误解是非常普遍的，因此，人们对于高指数防晒霜的普遍预期是它将保护人们不被太阳晒伤.故答案为B)。
　　57.A)事实细节题。文章首段第二句提到，本周《自然》杂志的一项研究表明，尽管防晒指数为50的防晒霜能够减少黑瘤的数量，并延缓其出现，但却并不能阻止其发生。由此可见，此项研究表明高指数的防晒霜并不能有效阻止黑瘤的发生，故答案为　　A)。
　　58.D)推理判断题。文章第二段首句指出，对于防晒霜减少黑瘤的有效性一直存在争议，第二句则举例说明，提到2011年澳大利亚一项涉及1，621人的研究发现，随机抽取的每天使用防晒霜的人群患黑瘤的几率是需要时才使用面霜的人群的一半。由此可知，根据此项研究，每天使用防晒霜的确能够降低患黑瘤的几率，即坚持使用防晒霜是有一定效果的，故答案为D)。
　　59.C)推理判断题。该段第三、四句承接上文，介绍了澳大利亚的第二项相关研究，第五句则是作者对研究过程与结果的主观评论，指出，由于此研究基于人们对他们一生中每个十年所采取防晒措施的回忆，因此并不完全可靠。由此可见，此研究并不是基于对被研究对象的直接观察，故答案为C)。
　　60.A)推理判断题。文章第四段第一句提到，正如澳大利亚人“套上一涂上一扣上”运动的数据所显示的，综合使用防晒霜和皮肤遮盖措施能够降低黑瘤发病率，第二句据此提出作者自己的观点和建议：如果今年夏天有热浪，我们也最好套上T恤，抹上防晒霜，并且扣上帽子。也就是说，作者建议我们同时使用防晒霜和衣服、帽子等其他防护措施，故答案为A)。

　　61.B)事实细节题。文章开篇即指出，在发达国家，与技术水平较低的人相比，受教育程度较高的人工作年限越来越长。由此可见，目前在发达国家的劳动力大军中，学历较高的人工作时间更长，故答案为B)。
　　62.B)事实细节题。文章首段第三句承接上文指出，这一差距正是不断加剧的高学历高收入富人与无技术低收入穷人之间两极分化的部分表现。第四句进一步分析了原因，即迅速发展的技术使高技术人群的收入增加，同时也压缩了那些无技术人群的收入。由此可见，迅速发展的技术就是加剧贫富差距的主要原因，故答案为B)。
　　63.A)事实细节题。文章第二段第三句指出，20世纪，更加长寿造成了退休生活的年份更长而不是工作的年份更长，这一经历使得观察家们相信，这一变化将导致经济增长减缓，同时，退休金申领人数的激增将产生政府预算问题。由此可知，根据20世纪的经历，观察家们预测到的问题之一是经济增长将减缓，故答案为A)。
　　64.C)事实细节题。文章第四段第二句和第三句提到，许多欧洲国家政府已经摒弃了曾鼓励人们尽早退休的政策。预期寿命的延长以及慷慨的固定养老金计划被不再慷慨的固定缴费养老金计划所替代，这些都意味着甚至有钱人也必须延长工作年限以获得舒适的退休生活。由此可知，政策的变化带来的后果是甚至有钱人也不得不为了在退休后过上舒适的生活而延长工作年限，故答案为C)。
　　65.D)推理判断题。文章第四段第四句提到，工作性质的变化也起到了很大作用，第五句进而对工
作性质的变化进行了分析，指出对那些高学历人士而言，工作报酬在大幅增加，这些人将继续获得较高的收入，直到老年，因为当今的老龄高学历人群比上一代人工作更有成效，第六句对上文进行了总结，得出结论，技术革新可能将进一步增强这一转变：作为计算机的补充的技能，从经营管理技巧到创新能力，都不会随着年龄的增长而衰退。由此可见，21世纪的工作特点是，比起年龄问题，经营管理技巧、创新能力等技能将更加被看重，故答案为D)。

　　参考译文：
　　China?is?one?of?the?most?ancient?civilizations?across?the?world,?from?which?many?elementsthat?construct?the?foundation?of?the?modem?world?are?derived.Now?China?has?the?world'sfastest?growing?economy?and?is?experiencing?a?new?industrial?revolution.It?has?alSo?launchedan?ambitious?space?exploration?plan,?including?the?building?of?a?space?station?by2020.Currently,?being?one?of?the?largest?exporters?in?the?world,?China?is?attracting?massiveforeign?investment.Meanwhile,?it?has?invested?billions?of?dollars?overseas?as?well.In?2011,?Chinasurpassed?Japan,?becoming?the?second?largest?economic?entity?in?the?world.

　　1.翻译第一句时需要注意，“……之一”的表述中，名词使用复数形式，“最古老的文明之一”刚译为one?ofthemost?ancient?civilizations或one?of?the?oldest?civilizations。
　　2.翻译第二句时，需要注意句子的主干为“元素起源于中国”，谓语动词“起源于”可译为be?derived?from或originate?from；定语“构成现代世界基础的”较长，可处理为定语从旬来修饰先行词“元素”；“构成……基础”可译为cons.Ia-uct?the?foundation?of或form?the?basis?of。由于第一句和第二句均为简单句，都出现了“中国”一词，翻译时既可以单独成句，也可以合二为一。本译文采用后者，将第一句作为主句，第二句处理为定语从句，用介词+which来引导，修饰第一句中的China，从而使译文更加简洁连贯。
　　3.翻译第三句时，需要注意该句主语为“中国”，旬中有两个并列谓语“拥有”和“经历”。“拥有”表示的是客观事实，可采用一般现在时，“正经历着”强调当前的情况，可采用现在进行时；“工业革命”可译为industrialrevolution。
　　4.第四句中“太空探索计划”可直译为space?exploration?plan，也可意译为plan?for?exploring?theouter?space；“启动”可译为launch或start。
　　5.第五句和第三句结构相似，该句有两种译法。可以翻译为两个并列的简单句，也可以将“中国正在吸引大量外国投资’’译为主句，时态为现在进行时；“是世界最大的出口国之一”采用非谓语结构，译为being?one?ofthelargest?exporters?in?the?world，避免单调和重复。
　　6.第六句为简单句，“在海外投资”译为invest?overseas，“数十亿”译为billions?of。
　　7.翻译最后一句时应注意时态。该句表述的是过去的事实，应使用一般过去时。“超越”译为surpass；“成为”这个短语有两种译法，可以将“超越”和“成为”处理为两个并列的动作，译为became?the?secondlargesteconomy?in?the?world：也可以将“成为”处理为现在分词作状语，表示结果，译为becoming?thesecond?largesteconomic?entity?in?the?world。

　　B．EDX，the?nonprofit?enterprise?founded?by?Harvard?and?the?Massachusetts?Institute?ofTechnology(MIT)to?offer?courses?on?the?Internet，has?just?introduced?such?a?system?and?willmake?its?automated(自动的)software?available?free?on?the?Web?to?any?institution?that?wants?touse?it．The?software?uses?artificial?intelligence?to?grade?student?essays?and?short?writtenanswers，freeing?professors?for?other?tasks．
　　C．The?new?service?will?bring?the?educational?consortium(联盟)into?a?growing?conflict?overthe?role?of?automation?in?education．Although?automated?grading?systems?for?multiple—choiceand?true—false?tests?are?now?widespread，the?use?of?artificial?intelligence?technology?tograde?essay?answers?has?not?yet?received?widespread?acceptance?by?educators?and?has?manycritics.
　　D．Anant?Agarwal，an?electrical?engineer?who?is?president?of?EDX，predicted?that?theinstant—grading?software?would?be?a?useful?teaching?tool?enabling?students?to?take?tests?andwrite?essays?over?and?over?and?improve?the?quality?of?their?answers．He?said?the?technologywould?offer?distinct?advantages?over?the?traditional?classroom?system，where?students?oftenwait?days?or?weeks?lor?grades．“There?is?a?huge?value?in?learning?with?instantfeedback，”Dr．Agarwal?said．“Students?are?telling?us?they?learn?much?better?with?instantfeedback．”

　　Such?choices?impact?who?moves?up?in?the?organization．While?you’re?away，someone?elseis?doing?your?work，making?your?sales，taking?care?of?your?customers．That?can’t?help?you?atwork．It?can?only?hurt?you．Women，of?course，face?the?same?issues?of?returning?after?a?longabsence．But?with?many?more?women?than?men?choosing?to?leave?the?workforce?entirely?toraise?families，returning?from?an?extended?　　parental?leave?doesn’t?raise?as?many?eyebrowsas?it?does?for?men．
　　Women?would?make?more?if?they?didn’t?break?their?earning?trajectory(轨迹)by?leaving?theworkforce，or?if?higher-paying?professions?were?more?family?friendly．In?the?foreseeablefuture，Stay?at?home?fathers?may?make?all?the?difference?for?individual?families．but?theirpresence?won’t?reduce?the?numbers?of?high?potential?women?who?are?forced?to?choosebetween?family?and?career．

　　参考译文：It?ls?reported?that?courier?services?in?China?will?deriver?about?l2?billion?parcels?thisyear，which?makes?it?possible?for?China?to?overtake?the?United?States?and?become?the?largestmarket?for?courier?services?in?the?world·?Most?of?the?parcels?contain?items?purchased?online．China?offers?millions?of?online?retailers?opportunities?to?sell?their?products?at?significantlycompetitive?prices．Chinese?consumers?bought$9?billion?worth?of?commodities?from?thenation’S?largest?shopping?platform?just?on?the?day?of?11th?November．Since?there?are?manysuch?special?shopping?days?in?China，it?is?no?wonder?that?China’s?courier?services?haveexpanded．

　　1.第一句中，“据报道”译为It?is?reported?that…。“120亿”译为l2?billion，这里应注意英文中的数字与汉语中的数字表达的差异。“包裹”可以用parcel或package等词来表达。
　　2.在翻译第二句时，由于该句与第一句关系密切，故可以将该句处理为一个由which引导的非限制性定语从句。“使……有可能”采用make?it?possible?for?sb．to?do?sth．句式，其中it是形式宾语，for?sb．to?dosth．是直_F宾语。也可以将该句单独译为China?could?overtake?the?United?States?to?become?theworld，s?largest?eXDress?delivery?market．
　　3.第三句中，“装着”可译为contain，be?filled?with或be舢of。‘‘网上订购的物品，，译为itemspurchased／?ordered?online，英语中过去分词短语作定语修饰名词时后置。
　　4.第四句中，“给……零售商……的机会”译法较多，可以用0ffer?sb．sth．或provide?sth．to?sb．，即译为China?provides?opportunities?to?millions?of?online?retailers?to?sell?goods?at?significantlycompetitive?prices.
　　5.在翻译第五句时，应注意英文中习惯将时间状语放在句尾，因此需要调整语序。如果为了强调，也可以置于句首。“从国内最大的购物平台购买了价值90亿美元的商品”也可以意译为spent$9?billion?on?thelargest?shopping?platform?of?the?nation。
　　6.第六句和第七句是明显的因果关系，因此可以利用连词since将两句合并为一句。第六句中“有，，的含义是“存在，而不是”拥有”，因此本句最好用there?be句型。
　　7.第七句也可以独立成句，用therefore或thus等与上文衔接。第七句中‘‘不足为奇”可译为It／There?isno?wonde。that…，其中that引导的从句是真正主语。也可以保持原句语序，译为The?e即ansion?ofChina，s?express?industry?is?not?surprising?at?all．

When you look up at the night sky, what do you see? There are other __26__ bodies out there besides the moon and stars. One of the most __27__ of these is a comet (彗星).

Comets were formed around the same time the Earth was formed. They are __28__ ice and other frozen liquids and gases. __29__ these "dirty snowballs" begin to orbit the sun, just as the planets do.

As a comet gets closer to the sun, some gases in it begin to unfreeze. They __30__ dust particles from the comet to form a huge cloud. As the comet gets even nearer to the sun, a solar wind blows the cloud behind the comet, thus forming its tail. The tail and the __31__ fuzzy (模糊的) atmosphere around a comet are __32__ that can help identify this __33__ in the night sky.

In any given year, about a dozen known comets come close to the sun in their orbits. The average person can't see them all, of course. Usually there is only one or two a year bright enough to be seen with the __34__ eye. Comet Hale-Bopp, discovered in 1995, was an unusually bright comet. Its orbit brought it __35__ close to the Earth, within 122 million miles of it. But Hale-Bopp came a long way on its earthly visit. It won't be back for another four thousand years or so.

However, they generally agree with the idea that inequality in the information society is __36__ different from that of an industrial society. As informatization progresses in society, the cause and structural nature of social inequality changes as well.

It seems that the information society __37__ the quantity of information available to the members of a society by revolutionizing the ways of using and exchanging information. But such a view is a __38__ analysis based on the quantity of information supplied by various forms of the mass media. A different __39__ is possible when the actual amount of information __40__ by the user is taken into account. In fact, the more information __41__ throughout the entire society, the wider the gap becomes between "information haves" and "information have-nots" , leading to digital divide.

In terms of class, digital divide exists among different types of workers and between the upper and middle classes and the lower class.

Joy: A Subject Schools Lack
Becoming educated should not require giving up pleasure.

A) When Jonathan Swift proposed, in 1729, that the people of Ireland eat their children, he insisted it would solve three problems at once: feed the hungry masses, reduce the population during a severe depression, and stimulate the restaurant business. Even as a satire (讽刺), it seems disgusting and shocking in America with its child-centered culture. But actually, the country is closer to his proposal than you might think.

B) If you spend much time with educators and policy makers, you'll hear a lot of the following words: "standards," "results," "skills," "self-control," "accountability," and so on. I have visited some of the newer supposedly "effective" schools, where children shout slogans in order to leam self-control or must stand behind their desk when they can't sit still.

C) A look at what goes on in most classrooms these days makes it abundantly clear that when people think about education, they are not thinking about what it feels like to be a child, or what makes childhood an important and valuable stage of life in its own right.

D) I'm a mother of three, a teacher, and a developmental psychologist. So I've watched a lot of children—talking, playing, arguing, eating, studying, and being young. Here's what I've come to understand. The thing that sets children apart from adults is not their ignorance, nor their lack of skills. It's their enormous capacity for joy. Think of a 3-year-old lost in the pleasures of finding out what he can and cannot sink in the bathtub, a 5-year-old beside herself with the thrill of putting together strings of nonsensical words with her best friends, or an 11-year-old completely absorbed in a fascinating comic strip. A child's ability to become deeply absorbed in something, and derive intense pleasure from that absorption, is something adults spend the rest of their lives trying to return to.

E) A friend told me the following story. One day, when he went to get his 7-year-old son from soccer practice, his kid greeted him with a downcast face and a sad voice. The coach had criticized him for not focusing on his soccer drills. The little boy walked out of the school with his head and shoulders hanging down. He seemed wrapped in sadness. But just before he reached the car door, he suddenly stopped, crouching (蹲伏) down to peer at something on the sidewalk. His face went down lower and lower, and then, with complete joy he called out, "Dad. Come here. This is the strangest bug I've ever seen. It has, like, a million legs. Look at this. It's amazing. " He looked up at his father, his features overflowing with energy and delight. "Can't we stay here for just a minute? I want to find out what he does with all those legs. This is the coolest ever. "

F) The traditional view of such moments is that they constitute a charming but irrelevant byproduct of youth—something to be pushed aside to make room for more important qualities, like perseverance (坚持不懈), obligation, and practicality. Yet moments like this one are just the kind of intense Absoiption and pleasure adults spend the rest of their lives seeking. Human lives are governed by the desire to experience joy. Becoming educated should not require giving up joy but rather lead to finding joy in new kinds of things: reading novels instead of playing with small figures, conducting experiments instead of sinking cups in the bathtub, and debating serious issues rather than stringing together nonsense words, for example. In some cases, schools should help children find new, more grown-up ways of doing the same things that are constant sources of joy: making art, making friends, making decisions.

G) Building on a child's ability to feel joy, rather than pushing it aside, wouldn't be that hard. It would just require a shift in the education world's mindset (思维模式). Instead of trying to get children to work hard, why not focus on getting them to take pleasure in meaningful, productive activity, like making things, working with others, exploring ideas, and solving problems? These focuses are not so different from the things in which they delight.

H) Before you brush this argument aside as rubbish, or think of joy as an unaffordable luxury in a nation where there is awful poverty, low academic achievement, and high dropout rates, think again. The more horrible the school circumstances, the more important pleasure is to achieving any educational success.

I) Many of the assignments and rules teachers come up with, often because they are pressured by their administrators, treat pleasure and joy as the enemies of competence and responsibility. The assumption is that children shouldn't chat in the classroom because it hinders hard work; instead, they should leain to delay gratification (快乐) so that they can pursue abstract goals, like going to college.

J) Not only is this a boring and awful way to treat children, it makes no sense educationally. Decades of research have shown that in order to acquire skills and real knowledge in school, kids need to want to learn. You can force a child to stay in his or her seat, fill out a worksheet, or practice division. But you can't force the child to think carefully, er\joy books, digest complex information, or develop a taste for learning. To make that happen, you have to help the child find pleasure in
learning—to see school as a source of joy.

K) Adults tend to talk about learning as if it were medicine; unpleasant, but necessary and good for you. Why not instead think of learning as if it were food—something so valuable to humans that they have evolved to experience it as a pleasure?

L) Joy should not be trained out of children or left for after-school programs. The more difficult a child's life circumstances, the more important it is for that child to find joy in his or her classroom. "Pleasure" is not a dirty word. And it doesn't run counter to the goals of public education. It is, in fact, the precondition.

46. It will not be difficult to make learning a source of joy if educators change their way of thinking.
47. What distinguishes children from adults is their strong ability to derive joy from what they are doing.
48. Children in America are being treated with shocking cruelty.
49. It is human nature to seek joy in life.
50. Grown-ups are likely to think that learning to children is what medicine is to patients.
51. Bad school conditions make it all the more important to turn learning into a joyful experience.
52. Adults do not consider children's feelings when it comes to education.
53. Administrators seem to believe that only hard work will lead children to their educational goals.
54. In the so-called "effective" schools, children are taught self-control under a set of strict rules.
55. To make learning effective, educators have to ensure that children want to leam.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C. And D .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer. Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

When it's five o'clock, people leave their office. The length of the workday, for many workers, is defined by time. They leave when the clock tells them they're done.

These days, the time is everywhere-, not just on clocks or watches, but on cell-phones and computers. That may be a bad thing, particularly at work. New research shows that clock-based work schedules hinder morale (士气) and creativity.

Clock-timers organize their day by blocks of minutes and hours. For example: a meeting from 9 a. m. to 10 a. m. , research from 10 a. m. to noon, etc. On the other hand, task-timers have a list of things they want to accomplish. They work down the list, each task starts when the previous task is completed. It is said that all of us employ a mix of both these types of planning.

What, then, are the effects of thinking about time in these different ways? Does one make us more productive? Better at the tasks at hand? Happier? In experiments conducted by Tamar Avnet and Anne-Laure Sellier, they had participants organize different activities—from project planning, holiday shopping, to yoga—by time or to-do list to measure how they performed under "clock time" vs "task time. " They found clock timers to be more efficient but less happy because they felt little control Over their lives. Task timers are happier and more creative, but less productive. They tend to enjoy the moment when something good is happening, and seize opportunities that come up.

The researchers argue that task-based organizing tends to be undervalued and under-supported in business culture. Smart companies, they believe, will try to bake more task-based planning into their strategies.

This might be a small change to the way we view work and the office, but the researchers argue that it challenges a widespread characteristic of the economy: work organized by clock time. While most people will still probably need, and be, to some extent, clock-timers, task-based timing should be used when performing a job that requires more creativity. It'll make those tasks easier, and the task-doers will be happier.

56. What does the author think of time displayed everywhere?
A) It makes everybody time-conscious.
B) It is a convenience for work and life.
C) It may have a negative effect on creative work.
D) It clearly indicates the fast pace of modem life.

57. How do people usually go about their work according to the author?
A) They combine clock-based and task-based planning.
B) They give priority to the most urgent task on hand.
C) They set a time limit for each specific task.
D) They accomplish their tasks one by one.

58. What did Tamar Avnet and Anne-Laure Sellier find in their experiments about clock-timers?
A) They seize opportunities as they come up.
B) They always get their work done in time.
C) They have more control over their lives.
D) They tend to be more productive.

59. What do the researchers say about today's business culture?
A) It does not support the strategies adopted by smart companies.
B) It does not attach enough importance to task-based practice.
C) It places more emphasis on work efficiency than on workers' lives.
D) It aims to bring employees' potential and creativity into full play.

60. What do the researchers suggest?
A) Task-based timing is preferred for doing creative work.
B) It is important to keep a balance between work and life.
C) Performing creative jobs tends to make workers happier.
D) A scientific standard should be adopted in job evaluation.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

Martha Stewart was charged, tried and convicted of a crime in 2004. As she neared the end of her prison sentence, a well-known columnist wrote that she was " paying her dues," and that " there is simply no reason for anyone to attempt to deny her right to start anew. "

Surely, the American ideal of second chances should not be reserved only for the rich and powerful. Unfortunately, many federal and state laws impose post-conviction restrictions on a shockingly large number of Americans, who are prevented from ever fully paying their debt to society.
At least 65 million people in the United States have a criminal record. This can result in severe penalties that continue long after punishment is completed.

Many of these penalties are imposed regardless of the seriousness of the offense or the person's individual circumstances. Laws can restrict or ban voting, access to public housing, and professional and business licensing. They can affect a person's ability to get a job and qualification for benefits.
In all, more than 45,000 laws and rules serve to exclude vast numbers of people from fully participating in American life.

Some laws make sense. No one advocates letting someone convicted of pedophilia(恋童癖) work in a school. But too often collateral (附随的) consequences bear no relation to public safety. Should a woman who possessed a small amount of drugs years ago be permanently unable to be licensed as a nurse?

These laws are also counterproductive, since they make it harder for people with criminal records to find housing or land a job, two key factors that reduce backsliding.

A recent report makes several recommendations, including the abolition of most post-conviction penalties, except for those specifically needed to protect public safety. Where the penalties are not a must, they should be imposed only if the facts of a case support it.

The point is not to excuse or forget the crime. Rather, it is to recognize that in America's vast criminal justice system, second chances are crucial. It is in no one's interest to keep a large segment of the population on the margins of society.

【作文范文】
Listening Is More Important than Talking

Nowadays an old saying, "Listening is more important than talking", comes into vogue. The saying tells us the true essence of communication with others in the society, which means paying attention to others' opinions is much more important than expressing one's own words.

As for me, there are two reasons accounting for the correctness of this principle. To start with, listening shows your respect for others. In such a competitive society, willingness to listen can make you gain trust and friendship, which is the basic rule of socialization. A talkative person without ear is doomed to be alienated. Furthermore, listening can really benefit yourself. There is no denying that you are the one to make choices in your life. However, a variety of ideas from others will definitely enrich your mind and present some enlightenment to your future actions.

According to what is said above, listening truly outweighs talking on many occasions. In modern society, we need to master some communication skills. Only when we realize the importance of listening can we lead a better life.

Chinese parents tend to pay too much attention to their children's study to such an extent that they even don't require their children to help them do the chores. Their primary requirement for their children is to study hard, get good grades and go to famous universities. They believe this does good to their children because in Chinese society which is full of intense competition, only perfect academic performance can ensure a bright future. Chinese parents also believe if their children can make great achievements in the society, they will receive respect accordingly. Therefore, they are willing to sacrifice their own time, hobbies and interests to provide better conditions for their children.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived.You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter.Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

How to Eat Well
A) Why do so many Americans eat tons of processed food, the stuff that is correctly called junk (垃圾) should really carry warning labels?

B) It's not because fresh ingredients are hard to come by. Supermarkets offer more variety than ever, and there are over four times as many farmers' markets in the U. S. as there were 20 years ago. Nor is it for lack of available information. There are plenty of recipes (食谱), how-to videos and cooking classes available to anyone who has a computer, smartphone or television. If anything, the information is overwhelming.

C) And yet we aren't cooking. If you eat three meals a day and behave like most Americans, you probably get at least a third of your daily calories (卡路里) outside the home. Nearly two-thirds of us grab fast food once a week, and we get almost 25% of our daily calories from snacks. So we're eating out or taking in, and we don't sit down-or we do, but we hurry.

D) Shouldn't preparing-and consuming-food be a source of comfort, pride, health, well-being, relaxation, sociability? Something that connects us to other humans? Why would we want to outsource(外包) this basic task, especially when outsourcing it is so harmful?

E) When I talk about cooking, I'm not talking about creating elaborate dinner parties or three-day science projects. I'm talking about simple, easy, everyday meals. My mission is to encourage green hands and those lacking time or money to feed themselves. That means we need modest, realistic expectations, and we need to teach people to cook food that's good enough to share with family and friends.

F) Perhaps a return to real cooking needn't be far off. A recent Harris poll revealed that 79% of Americans say they enjoy cooking and 30% "love it" ; 14% admit to not enjoying kitchen work and just 7% won't go near the stove at all. But this doesn't necessarily translate to real cooking, and the result of this survey shouldn't surprise anyone: 52% of those 65 or older cook at home five or more times per week; only a third of young people do.

G) Back in the 1950s most of us grew up in households where Mom cooked virtually every night. The intention to put a home-cooked meal on the table was pretty much universal. Most people couldn't afford to do otherwise.

H) Although frozen dinners were invented in the '40s, their popularity didn't boom until televisions became popular a decade or so later. Since then, packaged, pre-prepared meals have been what's for dinner. The microwave and fast-food chains were the biggest catalysts (催化剂), but the big food companies—which want to sell anything except the raw ingredients that go into cooking—made the home cook an endangered species.

I) Still, I find it strange that only a third of young people report preparing meals at home regularly. Isn't this the same crowd that rails against processed junk and champions craft cooking? And isn't this the generation who say they're concerned about their health and the well-being of the planet? If these are truly the values of many young people, then their behavior doesn't match their beliefs.

J) There have been half-hearted but well-publicized efforts by some food companies to reduce calories in their processed foods, but the Standard American Diet is still the polar opposite of the healthy, mostly plant-based diet that just about every expert says we should be eating. Considering that the government's standards are not nearly ambitious enough, the picture is clear: by not cooking at home, we're not eating the right things, and the consequences are hard to overstate.

K) To help quantify (量化) the costs of a poor diet, I recently tried to estimate this impact in terms of a most famous food, the burger (汉堡包). I concluded that the profit from burgers is more than offset (抵消) by the damage they cause in health problems and environmental harm.

L) Cooking real food is the best defense—not to mention that any meal you're likely to eat at home contains about 200 fewer calories than one you would eat in a restaurant.

M) To those Americans for whom money is a concern, my advice is simple; Buy what you can afford, and cook it yourself. The common prescription is to primarily shop the grocery store, since that's where fresh produce, meat and seafood, and dairy are. And to save money and still eat well you don't need local, organic ingredients; all you need is real food. I'm not saying local food isn't better; it is. But there is plenty of decent food in the grocery stores.

N) The other sections you should get to know are the frozen foods and the canned goods. Frozen produce is still produce; canned tomatoes are still tomatoes. Just make sure you're getting real food without tons of added salt or sugar. Ask yourself, would Grandma consider this food? Does it look like something that might occur in nature? It's pretty much common sense; you want to buy food, not unidentifiable foodlike objects.

O) You don't have to hit the grocery store daily, nor do you need an abundance of skill. Since fewer than half of Americans say they cook at an intermediate level and only 20% describe their cooking skills as advanced, the crisis is one of confidence. And the only remedy for that is practice. There's nothing mysterious about cooking the evening meal. You just have to do a little thinking ahead and redefine what qualifies as dinner. Like any skill, cooking gets easier as you do it more; every time you cook, you advance your level of skills. Someday you won't even need recipes. My advice is that you not pay attention to the number of steps and ingredients, because they can be deceiving.

P) Time, I realize, is the biggest obstacle to cooking for most people. You must adjust your priorities to find time to cook. For instance, you can move a TV to the kitchen and watch your favorite shows while you're standing at the sink. No one is asking you to give up activities you like, but if you're watching food shows on TV, try cooking instead.

46. Cooking benefits people in many ways and enables them to connect with one another.
47. Abundant information about cooking is available either online or on TV.
48. Young people do less cooking at home than the elderly these days.
49. Cooking skills can be improved with practice.
50. In the mid-20th century, most families ate dinner at home instead of eating out.
51. Even those short of time or money should be encouraged to cook for themselves and their family.
52. Eating food not cooked by ourselves can cause serious consequences.
53. To eat well and still save money, people should buy fresh food and cook it themselves.
54. We get a fairly large portion of calories from fast food and snacks.
55. The popularity of TV led to the popularity of frozen food.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C. And D .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer. Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping-where you hand over notes and count out change in return-now happens only in the most minor of our retail encounters, like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a corner shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge retail stores-Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance-you don't go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa.

Which is nothing more or less than excellent service, if you have the money. But across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. But earning money isn't quick or easy for most of us. Isn't it a bit weird that spending it should happen in half a blink (眨眼) of an eye? Doesn't a wallet-that time-honoured Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness-represent something that matters?

But I'll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet-the way the fastenings and materials wear and tear and loosen with age, the plastic and paper and gold and silver, and handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets-is the very opposite of what our world is becoming. The opposite of a wallet is a smartphone or an iPad. The rounded edges, cool glass, smooth and unknowable as a pebble (鹅卵石). Instead of digging through pieces of paper and peering into comers, we move our fingers left and right. No more counting out coins. Show your wallet, if you still have one. It may not be here much longer.

56. What is happening to the wallet?
A) It is disappearing.         B) It is being fattened. 
C) It is becoming costly.      D) It is changing in style.

57. How are business transactions done in big modern stores?
A) Individually.             B) Electronically. 
C) In the abstract.           D) Via a cash register.

58. What makes the author feel uncomfortable nowadays?
A) Saving money is becoming a thing of the past.
B) The pleasing Friday-night feeling is fading.
C) Earning money is getting more difficult.
D) Spending money is so fast and easy.

59. Why does the author choose to write about what's happening to the wallet?
A) It represents a change in the modern world.
B) It has something to do with everybody's life.
C) It marks the end of a time-honoured tradition.
D) It is the concern of contemporary economists.

60. What can we infer from the passage about the author?
A) He is resistant to social changes.
B) He is against technological progress.
C) He feels reluctant to part with the traditional wallet.
D) He feels insecure in the ever-changing modern world.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

Everybody sleeps, but what people stay up late to catch-or wake up early in order not to miss?varies by culture.

From data collected, it seems the things that cause us to lose the most sleep, on average, are sporting events, time changes, and holidays.

Around the world, people changed sleep patterns thanks to the start or end of daylight savings time. Russians, for example, began to wake up about a half-hour later each day after President Vladimir Putin shifted the country permanently to "winter time" starting on October 26.

Russia's other late nights and early mornings generally correspond to public holidays. On New Year's Eve, Russians have the world's latest bedtime, hitting the hay at around 3:30 a. m.

Russians also get up an hour later on International Women's Day, the day for treating and celebrating female relatives.

Similarly, Americans' late nights, late mornings, and longest sleeps fall on three-day weekends.

Canada got the least sleep of the year the night it beat Sweden in the Olympic hockey (冰球) final. 

The World Cup is also chiefly responsible for sleep deprivation (剥夺). The worst night for sleep in the U. K. was the night of the England-Italy match on June 14. Brits stayed up a half-hour later to watch it, and then they woke up earlier than usual the next morning thanks to summer nights, the phenomenon in which the sun barely sets in northern countries in the summertime. That was nothing, though, compared to Germans, Italians, and the French, who stayed up around an hour and a half later on various days throughout the summer to watch the Cup.

It should be made clear that not everyone has a device to record their sleep patterns; in some of these nations, it's likely that only the richest people do. And people who elect to track their sleep may try to get more sleep than the average person. Even if that's the case, though, the above findings are still striking. If the most health-conscious among us have such deep swings in our shut-eye levels throughout the year, how much sleep are the rest of us losing?

【作文范文】
Learning Should Be a Lifelong Process

It is often said that learning is a daily experience and a lifetime mission. The saying indicates the importance of lifelong learning, which we have been lectured over and over again.

Lifelong learning is crucial to our life and career in modern society. Living in the Information Age, we have to keep pace with the times through ceaseless learning; otherwise, we'll be too outdated to seize any opportunities. For example, a taxi driver who learns to use a Taxi App such as Didi can make much more money than those who don't; a housewife who opens a shop online can even out-earn a white-collar worker. All of their success can be attributed to their constant learning in addition to the progress of technology.

As an old saying goes, it is never too old to learn. Thus, learning is an attitude regardless of age. Only through learning ceaselessly can we achieve our potential and live a better life in this rapidly developing society.

When you look up at the night sky, what do you see? There are other __26__ bodies out there besides the moon and stars. One of the most __27__ of these is a comet (彗星).

Comets were formed around the same time the Earth was formed. They are __28__ ice and other frozen liquids and gases. __29__ these "dirty snowballs" begin to orbit the sun, just as the planets do.

As a comet gets closer to the sun, some gases in it begin to unfreeze. They __30__ dust particles from the comet to form a huge cloud. As the comet gets even nearer to the sun, a solar wind blows the cloud behind the comet, thus forming its tail. The tail and the __31__ fuzzy (模糊的) atmosphere around a comet are __32__ that can help identify this __33__ in the night sky.

In any given year, about a dozen known comets come close to the sun in their orbits. The average person can't see them all, of course. Usually there is only one or two a year bright enough to be seen with the __34__ eye. Comet Hale-Bopp, discovered in 1995, was an unusually bright comet. Its orbit brought it __35__ close to the Earth, within 122 million miles of it. But Hale-Bopp came a long way on its earthly visit. It won't be back for another four thousand years or so.

A 4-year-old may __37__ that a sister has more fruit juice when it is only the shapes of the glasses that differ, not the __38__ of juice.

Yet children are smart in their own way. Like good little scientists, children are always testing their child-sized __39__ about how things work. When your child throws her spoon on the floor for the sixth time as you try to feed her, and you say, "That's enough! I will not pick up your spoon again!" the child will __40__ test your claim. Are you serious? Are you angiy? What will happen if she throws the spoon again? She is not doing this to drive you __41__ ; rather, she is learning that her desires and yours can differ, and that sometimes those __42__ are important and sometimes they are not.

How and why does children's thinking change? In the 1920s, Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget proposed that children's cognitive(认知的) abilities unfold __43__ , like the blooming of a flower, almost independent of what else is __44__ in their lives.

The Perfect Essay
A) Looking back on too many years of education, I can identify one truly impossible teacher. She cared about me, and my intellectual life, even when I didn't. Her expectations were high-impossibly so. She was an English teacher. She was also my mother.

B) When good students turn in an essay, they dream of their instructor returning it to them in exactly the same condition, save for a single word added in the margin of the final page: " Flawless. " This dream came true for me one afternoon in the ninth grade. Of course, I had heard that genius could show itself at an early age, so I was only slightly taken aback that I had achieved perfection at the tender age of 14. Obviously, I did what any professional writer would do; I hurried off to spread the good news. I didn't get very far. The first person I told was my mother.

C) My mother, who is just shy of five feet tall, is normally incredibly soft-spoken, but on the rare occasion when she got angry, she was terrifying. I am not sure if she was more upset by my hubris(得意忘形) or by the fact that my English teacher had let my ego get so out of hand. In any event, my mother and her red pen showed me how deeply flawed a flawless essay could be. At the time, I am sure she thought she was teaching me about mechanics, transitions (过渡), structure, style and voice. But what I learned, and what stuck with me through my time teaching writing at Harvard, was a deeper lesson about the nature of creative criticism.

D) First off, it hurts. Genuine criticism, the type that leaves a lasting mark on you as a writer, also leaves an existential imprint (印记) on you as a person. I have heard people say that a writer should never take criticism personally. I say that we should never listen to these people.

E) Criticism, at its best, is deeply personal, and gets to the heart of why we write the way we do. The intimate nature of genuine criticism implies something about who is able to give it, namely, someone who knows you well enough to show you how your mental life is getting in the way of good writing. Conveniently, they are also the people who care enough to see you through this painful realization. For me it took the form of my first, and I hope only, encounter with writer's block-I was not able to produce anything for three years.

F) Franz Kafka once said:" Writing is utter solitude (独处), the descent into the cold abyss (深渊) of oneself. " My mother's criticism had shown me that Kafka is right about the cold abyss, and when you make the introspective (内省的) descent that writing requires you are not always pleased by what you find. But, in the years that followed, her sustained tutoring suggested that Kafka might be wrong about the solitude. I was lucky enough to find a critic and teacher who was willing to make the journey of writing with me. "It is a thing of no great difficulty," according to Plutarch, "to raise objections against another man's speech, it is a very easy matter; but to produce a better in its place is a work extremely troublesome. " I am sure I wrote essays in the later years of high school without my mother's guidance, but I can't recall them. What I remember, however, is how she took up the "extremely troublesome" work of ongoing criticism.

G) There are two ways to interpret Plutarch when he suggests that a critic should be able to produce " a better in its place. " In a straightforward sense, he could mean that a critic must be more talented than the artist she critiques (评论). My mother was well covered on this count. But perhaps Plutarch is suggesting something slightly different, something a bit closer to Marcus Cicero's claim that one should " criticize by creation, not by finding fault. " Genuine criticism creates a precious opening for an author to become better on his own terms-a process that is often extremely painful, but also almost always meaningful.

H) My mother said she would help me with my writing, but first I had to help myself. For each assignment, I was to write the best essay I could. Real criticism is not meant to find obvious mistakes, so if she found any-the type I could have found on my own-I had to start from scratch. From scratch. Once the essay was " flawless," she would take an evening to walk me through my errors. That was when true criticism, the type that changed me as a person, began.

I) She criticized me when I included little-known references and professional jargon (行话) ?She had no patience for brilliant but irrelevant figures of speech. "Writers can't bluff (虚张声势) their way through ignorance. " That was news to me-I would need to find another way to structure my daily existence.

J) She trimmed back my flowery language, drew lines through my exclamation marks and argued for the value of restraint in expression. " John," she almost whispered. I leaned in to hear her: "I can't hear you when you shout at me. " So I stopped shouting and bluffing, and slowly my writing improved.

K) Somewhere along the way I set aside my hopes of writing that flawless essay. But perhaps I missed something important in my mother's lessons about creativity and perfection. Perhaps the point of writing the flawless essay was not to give up, but to never willingly finish. Whitman repeatedly reworked "Song of Myself' between 1855 and 1891. Repeatedly. We do our absolute best with a piece of writing, and come as close as we can to the ideal. And, for the time being, we settle. In critique, however, we are forced to depart, to give up the perfection we thought we had achieved for the chance of being even a little bit better. This is the lesson I took from my mother.. If perfection were possible, it would not be motivating.

46. The author was advised against the improper use of figures of speech.
47. The author's mother taught him a valuable lesson by pointing out lots of flaws in his seemingly perfect essay.
48. A writer should polish his writing repeatedly so as to get closer to perfection.
49. Writers may experience periods of time in their life when they just can't produce anything.
50. The author was not much surprised when his school teacher marked his essay as "flawless".
51. Criticizing someone's speech is said to be easier than coming up with a better one.
52. The author looks upon his mother as his most demanding and caring instructor.
53. The criticism the author received from his mother changed him as a person.
54. The author gradually improved his writing by avoiding fancy language.
55. Constructive criticism gives an author a good start to improve his writing.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C. And D .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer. Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something unique about it? 

It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US either. What does it take to make a Silicon Valley?

It's the right people. If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley.

You only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub (中心): rich people and nerds (痴迷科研的人)

Observation bears this out. Within the US, towns have become startup hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds. Few startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full of rich people, it has few nerds. It's not the kind of place nerds like.

Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people. The top US Computer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon. MIT yielded Route 128. Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley. But what did Cainegie-Mellon yield in Pittsburgh? And what happened in Ithaca, home of Cornell University, which is also high on the list?

I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can answer for both. The weather is terrible, particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So while there're plenty of hackers (电脑迷) who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them.

Do you really need the rich people? Wouldn't it work to have the government invest in the nerds? No, it would not. Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people. They tend to have a lot of experience themselves in the technology business. This helps them pick the right startups, and means they can supply advice and connections as well as money. And the fact that they have a personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.

56. What do we learn about Silicon Valley from the passage?
A) Its success is hard to copy anywhere else.
B) It is the biggest technology hub in the US.
C) Its fame in high technology is incomparable.
D) It leads the world in information technology.

57. What makes Miami unfit to produce a Silicon Valley?
A) Lack of incentive for investment.    B) Lack of the right kind of talents. 
C) Lack of government support.       D) Lack of famous universities.

58. In what way is Carnegie-Mellon different from Stanford, Berkeley and MIT?
A) Its location is not as attractive to rich people.
B) Its science departments are not nearly as good.
C) It does not produce computer hackers and nerds.
D) It does not pay much attention to business startups.

59. What does the author imply about Boston?
A) It has pleasant weather all year round.
B) It produces wealth as well as high-tech.
C) It is not likely to attract lots of investors and nerds.
D) It is an old city with many sites of historical interest.

60. What does the author say about startup investors?
A) They are especially wise in making investments.
B) They have good connections in the government.
C) They can do more than providing money.
D) They are rich enough to invest in nerds.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.

It's nice to have people of like mind around. Agreeable people boost your confidence and allow you to relax and feel comfortable. Unfortunately, that comfort can hinder the very learning that can expand your company and your career.

It's nice to have people agree, but you need conflicting perspectives to dig out the truth. If everyone around you has similar views, your work will suffer from confirmation bias(偏颇).

Take a look at your own network. Do your contacts share your point of view on most subjects? If yes, it's time to shake things up. As a leader, it can be challenging to create an environment in which people will freely disagree and argue, but as the saying goes: From confrontation comes brilliance.

It's not easy for most people to actively seek conflict. Many spend their lives trying to avoid arguments. There's no need to go out and find people you hate, but you need to do some self-assessment to determine where you have become stale in your thinking. You may need to start by encouraging your current network to help you identify your blind spots.

Passionate, energetic debate does not require anger and hard feelings to be effective. But it does require moral strength. Once you have worthy opponents, set some ground rules so everyone understands responsibilities and boundaries. The objective of this debating game is not to win but to get to the truth that will allow you to move faster, farther, and better.

Fierce debating can hurt feelings, particularly when strong personalities are involved. Make sure you check in with your opponents so that they are not carrying the emotion of the battles beyond the battlefield. Break the tension with smiles and humor to reinforce the idea that this is friendly discourse and that all are working toward a common goal.

Reward all those involved in the debate sufficiently when the goals are reached. Let your sparring partners (拳击陪练) know how much you appreciate their contribution. The more they feel appreciated, the more they'll be willing to get into the ring next time.

62. What does the author suggest leaders do?   
A) Avoid arguments with business partners.    B) Encourage people to disagree and argue.
C) Build a wide and strong business network.   D) Seek advice from their worthy competitors.

63. What is the purpose of holding a debate?

2015年12月全国大学英语四级考试（第三套）参考答案

【作文范文】
Be Participants Rather than Onlookers

Just as the saying goes, never go out there to see what happens, go out there to make things happen. It obviously emphasizes the importance of being participants instead of mere onlookers in life.

There are several reasons accounting for it. To start with, you will never learn the essence of life unless you try something on your own. Whether it's a success or a failure, it will make your life more colorful. Furthermore, chances are only for those who are brave enough to challenge themselves. They tend to have more choices and opportunities than others. Last but not least, Rome is not built in one day. Only if you are a doer rather than a watcher can you get life-long valuable experience.

It is no exaggeration to say that many of the young generations prefer to be onlookers, which seems to be easier and less stressful. But this kind of attitude is devastating. We should start making a change by applying what we have learned into practice, and play our part in bettering our world, which will finally benefit not only ourselves but also the future generations.

Finding?the?Right?Home—and?Contentment,Too
[A]?When?your?elderly?relative?needs?to?enter?some?sort?of?long-term?care?facility—a?momentfew?parents?or?children?approach?without?fear—what?you?would?like?is?to?have?everything?madeclear.

[C]?I?am?about?to?make?things?more?complicated?by?suggesting?that?what?kind?of?facility?anolder?person?lives?in?may?matter?less?than?we?have?assumed.?And?that?the?characteristicsadult?children?look?for?when?they?begin?the?search?are?not?necessarily?the?things?that?make?adifference?to?the?people?who?are?going?to?move?in.?I?am?not?talking?about?the?quality?of?care,let?me?hastily?add.?Nobody?flourishes?in?a?gloomy?environment?with?irresponsible?staff?anda?poor?safety?record.?But?an?accumulating?body?of?research?indicates?that?some?distinctionsbetween?one?type?of?elder?care?and?another?have?little?real?bearing?on?how?well?residents?do.
[D]?The?most?recent?of?these?studies,?published?in?The?Journal?of?Applied?Gerontology,?surveyed150?Connecticut?residents?of?assisted?living,?nursing?homes?and?smaller?residential?care?homes(known?in?some?states?as?board?and?care?homes?or?adult?care?homes).?Researchers?from?theUniversity?of?Connecticut?Health?Center?asked?the?residents?a?large?number?of?questions?abouttheir?quality?of?life,?emotional?well-being?and?social?interaction,?as?well?as?about?thequality?of?the?facilities.
[E]"We?thought?we?would?see?differences?based?on?the?housing?types,"?said?the?lead?author?ofthe?study,?Julie?Robison,?an?associate?professor?of?medicine?at?the?university.?A?reasonableassumption—?don't?families?struggle?to?avoid?nursing?homes?and?suffer?real?guilt?if?theycan't?
[F]?In?the?initial?results,?assisted?living?residents?did?paint?the?most?positive?picture.?They?wereless?likely?to?report?symptoms?of?depression?than?those?in?the?other?facilities,?for?instance,?andless?likely?to?be?bored?or?lonely.?They?scored?higher?on?social?interaction.
[G]?But?when?the?researchers?plugged?in?a?number?of?other?variables,?such?differencesdisappeared.?It?is?not?the?housing?type,?they?found,?that?creates?differences?in?residents'responses. "It?is?the?characteristics?of?the?specific?environment?they?are?in,?combined?withtheir?own?personal?characteristics—how?healthy?they?feel?they?are,?their?age?and?maritalstatus,"?Dr.?Robison?explained.?Whether?residents?felt?involved?in?the?decision?to?move?andhow?long?they?had?lived?there?also?proved?significant.
[H]?An?elderly?person?who?describes?herself?as?in?poor?health,?therefore,?might?be?no?lessdepressed?in?assisted?living?(even?if?her?children?preferred?it)?than?in?a?nursing?home.?Aperson?who?had?input?into?where?he?would?move?and?has?had?time?to?adapt?to?it?might?do?aswell?in?a?nursing?home?as?in?a?small?residential?care?home,?other?factors?being?equal.?It?is?aninteraction?between?the?person?and?the?place,?not?the?sort?of?place?in?itself,?that?leads?tobetter?or?worse?experiences. "You?can't?just?say,?'Let's?put?this?person?in?a?residential?care?homeinstead?of?a?nursing?home—she?will?be?much?better?off,'"?Dr.?Robison?said.?What?matters,?sheadded, "is?a?combination?of?what?people?bring?in?with?them,?and?what?they?find?there."
[I]?Such?findings,?which?run?counter?to?common?sense,?have?surfaced?before.?In?a?multi-statestudy?of?assisted?living,?for?instance,?University?of?North?Carolina?researchers?found?that?a?hostof?variables—the?facility's?type,?size?or?age;?whether?a?chain?owned?it;?how?attractive?theneighborhood?was—had?no?significant?relationship?to?how?the?residents?fared?in?terms?of?illness,mental?decline,?hospitalizations?or?mortality.?What?mattered?most?was?the?residents,?physicalhealth?and?mental?status.?What?people?were?like?when?they?came?in?had?greaterconsequence?than?what?happened?once?they?were?there.

"Families?can?look?a?bit?more?for?where?the?residents?are?going?to?be?happy,"?Dr.?Sloane?said.And?involving?the?future?resident?in?the?process?can?be?very?important.

Passage?One
Questions?46?to?50?are?based?on?the?following?passage.

As?Artificial?Intelligence?(AI)?becomes?increasingly?sophisticated,?there?are?growing?concernsthat?robots?could?become?a?threat.?This?danger?can?be?avoided,?according?to?computer?scienceprofessor?Stuart?Russell,?if?we?figure?out?how?to?turn?human?values?into?a?programmable?code.
Russell?argues?that?as?robots?take?on?more?complicated?tasks,?it's?necessary?to?translate?ourmorals?into?AI?language.
For?example,?if?a?robot?does?chores?around?the?house,?you?wouldn't?want?it?to?put?the?pet?cat?inthe?oven?to?make?dinner?for?the?hungry?children. "You?would?want?that?robot?preloaded?with?agood?set?of?values,"?said?Russell.
Some?robots?are?already?programmed?with?basic?human?values.?For?example,?mobile?robotshave?been?programmed?to?keep?a?comfortable?distance?from?humans.?Obviously?there?arecultural?differences,?but?if?you?were?talking?to?another?person?and?they?came?up?close?in?yourpersonal?space,?you?wouldn't?think?that's?the?kind?of?thing?a?properly?brought-up?person?woulddo.
It?will?be?possible?to?create?more?sophisticated?moral?machines,?if?only?we?can?find?a?way?toset?out?human?values?as?clear?rules.
Robots?could?also?learn?values?from?drawing?patterns?from?large?sets?of?data?on?humanbehavior.?They?are?dangerous?only?if?programmers?are?careless.
The?biggest?concern?with?robots?going?against?human?values?is?that?human?beings?fail?to?dosufficient?testing?and?they've?produced?a?system?that?will?break?some?kind?of?taboo?(禁忌).
One?simple?check?would?be?to?program?a?robot?to?check?the?correct?course?of?action?with?ahuman?when?presented?with?an?unusual?situation.
If?the?robot?is?unsure?whether?an?animal?is?suitable?for?the?microwave,?it?has?the?opportunityto?stop,?send?out?beeps?(嘟嘟声),?and?ask?for?directions?from?a?human.?If?we?humans?aren'tquite?sure?about?a?decision,?we?go?and?ask?somebody?else.
The?most?difficult?step?in?programming?values?will?be?deciding?exactly?what?we?believe?is?moral,and?how?to?create?a?set?of?ethical?rules.?But?if?we?come?up?with?an?answer,?robots?could?begood?for?humanity.
46.?What?does?the?author?say?about?the?threat?of?robots?
A)?It?may?constitute?a?challenge?to?computer?programmers.
B)?It?accompanies?all?machinery?involving?high?technology.
C)?It?can?be?avoided?if?human?values?are?translated?into?their?language.
D)?It?has?become?an?inevitable?peril?as?technology?gets?more?sophisticated.
47.?What?would?we?think?of?a?person?who?invades?our?personal?space?according?to?the?author?
A)?They?are?aggressive.
B)?They?are?outgoing.
C)?They?are?ignorant.
D)?They?are?ill-bred.
48.?How?do?robots?learn?human?values?
A)?By?interacting?with?humans?in?everyday?life?situations.
B)?By?following?the?daily?routines?of?civilized?human?beings.
C)?By?picking?up?patterns?from?massive?data?on?human?behavior.
D)?By?imitating?the?behavior?of?properly?brought-up?human?beings.
49.?What?will?a?well-programmed?robot?do?when?facing?an?unusual?situation?
A)?Keep?a?distance?from?possible?dangers.
B)?Stop?to?seek?advice?from?a?human?being.
C)?Trigger?its?built-in?alarm?system?at?once.
D)?Do?sufficient?testing?before?taking?action,
50.?What?is?most?difficult?to?do?when?we?turn?human?values?into?a?programmable?code?
A)?Determine?what?is?moral?and?ethical.
B)?Design?some?large-scale?experiments.
C)?Set?rules?for?man-machine?interaction.
D)?Develop?a?more?sophisticated?program.

Passage?Two
Questions?51?to?55?are?based?on?the?following?passage.

Why?do?some?people?live?to?be?older?than?others??You?know?the?standard?explanations:?keepinga?moderate?diet,?engaging?in?regular?exercise,?etc.?But?what?effect?does?your?personality?haveon?your?longevity?(长寿)??Do?some?kinds?of?personalities?lead?to?longer?lives??A?new?study?inthe?Journal?of?American?Geriatrics?Society?looked?at?this?question?by?examining?the?personalitycharacteristics?of?246?children?of?people?who?had?lived?to?be?at?least?100.
The?study?shows?that?those?living?the?longest?are?more?outgoing,?more?active?and?lessneurotic(神经质的)than?other?people.?Long-living?women?are?also?more?likely?to?be?sympatheticand?cooperative?than?women?with?a?normal?life?span.?These?findings?are?in?agreement?withwhat?you?would?expect?from?the?evolutionary?theory:?those?who?like?to?make?friends?and?helpothers?can?gather?enough?resources?to?make?it?through?tough?times.
Interestingly,?however,?other?characteristics?that?you?might?consider?advantageous?had?noimpact?on?whether?study?participants?were?likely?to?live?longer.?Those?who?were?more?self-disciplined,?for?instance,?were?no?more?likely?to?live?to?be?very?old.?Also,?being?open?to?newideas?had?no?relationship?to?long?life,?which?might?explain?all?those?bad-tempered?old?peoplewho?are?fixed?in?their?ways.
Whether?you?can?successfully?change?your?personality?as?an?adult?is?the?subject?of?alongstanding?psychological?debate.?But?the?new?paper?suggests?that?if?you?want?long?life,you?should?strive?to?be?as?outgoing?as?possible.
Unfortunately,?another?recent?study?shows?that?your?mother's?personality?may?also?helpdetermine?your?longevity.?That?study?looked?at?nearly?28,000?Norwegian?mothers?and?foundthat?those?moms?who?were?more?anxious,?depressed?and?angry?were?more?likely?to?feed?theirkids?unhealthy?diets.?Patterns?of?childhood?eating?can?be?hard?to?break?when?we're?adults,which?may?mean?that?kids?of?depressed?moms?end?up?dying?younger.
Personality?isn't?destiny?(命运),?and?everyone?knows?that?individuals?can?learn?to?change.?Butboth?studies?show?that?long?life?isn't?just?a?matter?of?your?physical?health?but?of?your?mentalhealth.
51.?The?aim?of?the?study?in?the?Journal?of?the?American?Geriatrics?Society?is?____.
A)?to?see?whether?people's?personality?affects?their?life?span
B)?to?find?out?if?one's?lifestyle?has?any?effect?on?their?health
C)?to?investigate?the?role?of?exercise?in?living?a?long?life
D)?to?examine?all?the?factors?contributing?to?longevity
52.?What?does?the?author?imply?about?outgoing?and?sympathetic?people?

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Contrary to popular belief, older people generally do not want to live with their children. Moreover, most adult children __26__ every bit as much care and support to their aging parents as was the case in the "good old days", and most older people do not feel __27__ .
About 80% of people 65 years and older have living children, and about 90% of them have __28__ contact with their children. About 75% of elderly parents who don't go to nursing homes live within 30 minutes of at least one of their children.

Could Food Shortages Bring Down Civilization?
[A] For many years I have studied global agricultural, population, environmental and economic trends and their interactions. The combined effects of those trends and the political tensions they generate point to the breakdown of governments and societies. Yet I, too, have resisted the idea that food shortages could bring down not only individual governments but also our global civilization.
[B] I can no longer ignore that risk. Our continuing failure to deal with the environmental declines that are undermining the world food economy forces me to conclude that such a collapse is possible.
[C] As demand for food rises faster than supplies are growing, the resulting food-price inflation puts severe stress on the governments of many countries. Unable to buy grain or grow their own, hungry people take to the streets. Indeed, even before the steep climb in grain prices in 2008, the number of failing states was expanding. If the food situation continues to worsen, entire nations will break down at an ever increasing rate. In the 20th century the main threat to international security was superpower conflict; today it is failing states.
[D] States fail when national governments can no longer provide personal security, food security and basic social services such as education and health care. When governments lose their control on power, law and order begin to disintegrate. After a point, countries can become so dangerous that food relief workers are no longer safe and their programs are halted. Failing states are of international concern because they are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons and refugees (难民), threatening political stability everywhere.
[E] The surge in world grain prices in 2007 and 2008—and the threat they pose to food security—has a different, more troubling quality than the increases of the past. During the second half of the 20th century, grain prices rose dramatically several times. In 1972, for instance, the Soviets, recognizing their poor harvest early, quietly cornered the world wheat market. As a result, wheat prices elsewhere more than doubled, pulling rice and corn prices up with them. But this and other price shocks were event-driven—drought in the Soviet Union, crop-shrinking heat in the U.S. Corn Belt. And the rises were short-lived: prices typically returned to normal with the next harvest.
[F] In contrast, the recent surge in world grain prices is trend-driven, making it unlikely to reverse without a reversal in the trends themselves. On the demand side, those trends include the ongoing addition of more than 70 million people a year, a growing number of people wanting to move up the food chain to consume highly grain-intensive meat products, and the massive diversion (转向) of U.S. grain to the production of bio-fuel.
[G] As incomes rise among low-income consumers, the potential for further grain consumption is huge. But that potential pales beside the never-ending demand for crop-based fuels. A fourth of this year's U.S. grain harvest will go to fuel cars.
[H] What about supply? The three environmental trends—the shortage of fresh water, the loss of topsoil and the rising temperatures—are making it increasingly hard to expand the world's grain supply fast enough to keep up with demand. Of all those trends, however, the spread of water shortages poses the most immediate threat. The biggest challenge here is irrigation, which consumes 70% of the world's fresh water. Millions of irrigation wells in many countries are now pumping water out of underground sources faster than rainfall can refill them. The result is falling water tables (地下水位) in countries with half the world's people, including the three big grain producers—China, India and the U.S.
[I] As water tables have fallen and irrigation wells have gone dry, China's wheat crop, the world's largest, has declined by 8% since it peaked at 123 million tons in 1997. But water shortages are even more worrying in India. Millions of irrigation wells have significantly lowered water tables in almost every state.
[J] As the world's food security falls to pieces, individual countries acting in their own self-interest are actually worsening the troubles of many. The trend began in 2007, when leading wheat-exporting countries such as Russia and Argentina limited or banned their exports, in hopes of increasing local food supplies and thereby bringing down domestic food prices. Vietnam banned its exports for several months for the same reason. Such moves may eliminate the fears of those living in the exporting countries, but they are creating panic in importing countries that must rely on what is then left for export.
[K] In response to those restrictions, grain-importing countries are trying to nail down long-term trade agreements that would lock up future grain supplies. Food-import anxiety is even leading to new efforts by food-importing countries to buy or lease farmland in other countries. In spite of such temporary measures, soaring food prices and spreading hunger in many other countries are beginning to break down the social order.
[L] Since the current world food shortage is trend-driven, the environmental trends that cause it must be reversed. We must cut carbon emissions by 80% from their 2006 levels by 2020, stabilize the world's population at eight billion by 2040, completely remove poverty, and restore forests and soils. There is nothing new about the four objectives. Indeed, we have made substantial progress in some parts of the world on at least one of these—the distribution of family-planning services and the associated shift to smaller families.
[M] For many in the development community, the four objectives were seen as positive, promoting development as long as they did not cost too much. Others saw them as politically correct and morally appropriate. Now a third and far more significant motivation presents itself: meeting these goals may be necessary to prevent the collapse of our civilization. Yet the cost we project for saving civilization would amount to less than $200 billion a year, 1/6 of current global military spending. In effect, our plan is the new security budget.
36. The more recent steep climb in grain prices partly results from the fact that more and more people want to consume meat products.
37. Social order is breaking down in many countries because of food shortages.
38. Rather than superpower conflict, countries unable to cope with food shortages now constitute the main threat to world security.
39. Some parts of the world have seen successful implementation of family planning.
40. The author has come to agree that food shortages could ultimately lead to the collapse of world civilization.
41. Increasing water shortages prove to be the biggest obstacle to boosting the world's grain production.
42. The cost for saving our civilization would be considerably less than the world’s current military spending.
43. To lower domestic food prices, some countries limited or stopped their grain exports.
44. Environmental problems must be solved to ease the current global food shortage.
45. A quarter of this year's American grain harvest will be used to produce bio-fuel for cars.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
Declining mental function is often seen as a problem of old age, but certain aspects of brain function actually begin their decline in young adulthood, a new study suggests.
The study, which followed more than 2,000 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 60, found that certain mental functions—including measures of abstract reasoning, mental speed and puzzle-solving—started to dull as early as age 27.
Dips in memory, meanwhile, generally became apparent around age 37.
On the other hand, indicators of a person's accumulated knowledge—like performance on tests of vocabulary and general knowledge—kept improving with age, according to findings published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging.
The results do not mean that young adults need to start worrying about their memories. Most people's minds function at a high level even in their later years, according to researcher Timothy Salthouse.
"These patterns suggest that some types of mental flexibility decrease relatively early in adulthood, but that the amount of knowledge one has, and the effectiveness of integrating it with one's abilities, may increase throughout all of adulthood if there are no diseases," Salthouse said in a news release.
The study included healthy, educated adults who took standard tests of memory, reasoning and perception at the outset and at some point over the next seven years.
The tests are designed to detect subtle (细微的) changes in mental function, and involve solving puzzles, recalling words and details from stories, and identifying patterns in collections of letters and symbols.
In general, Salthouse and his colleagues found, certain aspects of cognition (认知能力) generally started to decline in the late 20s to 30s.
The findings shed light on normal age-related changes in mental function, which could aid in understanding the process of dementia (痴呆), according to the researchers.
"By following individuals over time," Salthouse said, "we gain insight in cognition changes, and may possibly discover ways to slow the rate of decline."
The researchers are currently analyzing the study participants' health and lifestyle to see which factors might influence age-related cognitive changes.

46. What is the common view of mental function?
A) It varies from person to person.
B) It weakens in one's later years.
C) It gradually expands with age.
D) It indicates one's health condition.

47. What does the new study find about mental functions?
A) Some diseases inevitably lead to their decline.
B) They reach a peak at the age of 20 for most people.
C) They are closely related to physical and mental exercise.
D) Some of them begin to decline when people are still young.

48. What does Timothy Salthouse say about people’s minds in most cases?
A) They tend to decline in people's later years.
B) Their flexibility determines one's abilities.
C) They function quite well even in old age.
D) Their functioning is still a puzzle to be solved.

49. Although people's minds may function less flexibly as they age, they _____.
A) may be better at solving puzzles
B) can memorize things with more ease
C) may have greater facility in abstract reasoning
D) can put what they have learnt into more effective use

50. According to Salthouse, their study may help us _____.
A) find ways to slow down our mental decline
B) find ways to boost our memories
C) understand the complex process of mental functioning
D) understand the relation between physical and mental health

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
The most important thing in the news last week was the rising discussion in Nashville about the educational needs of children. The shorthand (简写) educators use for this is "pre-K"—meaning instruction before kindergarten—and the big idea is to prepare 4-year-olds and even younger kids to be ready to succeed on their K-12 journey.
But it gets complicated. The concept has multiple forms, and scholars and policymakers argue about the shape, scope and cost of the ideal program.
The federal Head Start program, launched 50 years ago, has served more than 30 million children. It was based on concepts developed at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College by Susan Gray, the legendary pioneer in early childhood education research.
A new Peabody study of the Tennessee Voluntary Pre-K program reports that pre-K works, but the gains are not sustained through the third grade. It seems to me this highlights quality issues in elementary schools more than pre-K, and indicates longer-term success must connect pre-K with all the other issues related to educating a child.
Pre-K is controversial. Some critics say it is a luxury and shouldn't be free to families able to pay. Pre-K advocates insist it is proven and will succeed if integrated with the rest of the child's schooling. I lean toward the latter view.
This is, in any case, the right conversation to be having now as Mayor Megan Barry takes office. She was the first candidate to speak out for strong pre-K programming. The important thing is for all of us to keep in mind the real goal and the longer, bigger picture.
The weight of the evidence is on the side of pre-K that early intervention (干预) works. What government has not yet found is the political will to put that understanding into full practice with a sequence of smart schooling that provides the early foundation.
For this purpose, our schools need both the talent and the organization to educate each child who arrives at the schoolhouse door. Some show up ready, but many do not at this critical time when young brains are developing rapidly.

51. What does the author say about pre-kindergarten education?
A) It should cater to the needs of individual children.
B) It is essential to a person's future academic success.
C) Scholars and policymakers have different opinions about it.
D) Parents regard it as the first phase of children's development.

52. What does the new Peabody study find?
A) Pre-K achievements usually do not last long.
B) The third grade marks a new phase of learning.
C) The third grade is critical to children's development.
D) Quality has not been the top concern of pre-K programs.

53. When does the author think pre-K works the best?
A) When it is accessible to kids of all families.
B) When it is made part of kids' education.
C) When it is no longer considered a luxury.
D) When it is made fun and enjoyable to kids.

54. What do we learn about Mayor Megan Barry?
A) She knows the real goal of education.
B) She is a mayor of insight and vision.
C) She has once run a pre-K program.
D) She is a firm supporter of pre-K.

55. What does the author think is critical to kids' education?
A) Teaching method.
B) Kids' interest.
C) Early intervention.
D) Parents' involvement.

Directions:?In?this?section,?you?are?going?to?read?a?passage?with?ten?statements?attached?to?it.Each?statement?contains?information?given?in?one?of?the?paragraphs?Identify?the?paragraphfrom?which?the?information?is?derived.?You?may?choose?a?paragraph?more?than?once.?Eachparagraph?is?marked?with?a?letter.?Answer?the?questions?by?marking?the?corresponding?letter?onAnswer?Sheet?2.
[A]?Is?it?possible?to?enjoy?a?peaceful?life?in?a?world?that?is?increasingly?challenged?by?threatsand?uncertainties?from?wars,?terrorism,?economic?crises?and?a?widespread?outbreak?ofinfectious?diseases??The?answer?is?yes,?according?to?a?new?book?The?10?Golden?Rules:?AncientWisdom?from?the?Greek?Philosophers?on?Living?a?Good?Life.?The?book?is?co-authored?by?LongIsland?University's?philosophy?professor?Michael?Soupios?and?economics?professor?PanosMourdoukoutas.
[B]?The?wisdom?of?the?ancient?Greek?philosophers?is?timeless,?says?Soupios.?The?philosophyprofessor?says?it?is?as?relevant?today?as?when?it?was?first?written?centuries?ago. "There?is?noexpiration?(失效)date?on?wisdom,"?he?says. "There?is?no?shelf?life?on?intelligence.?I?think?thatthings?have?become?very?gloomy?these?days,?lots?of?misunderstanding,?misleading?cues,?alot?of?what?the?ancients?would?have?called?sophistry?(诡辩).?The?nice?thing?about?ancientphilosophy?as?offered?by?the?Greeks?is?that?they?tended?to?see?life?clear?and?whole,?in?a?way?thatwe?tend?not?to?see?life?today."
Examine?your?life
[C]?Soupios,?along?with?his?co-author?Panos?Mourdoukoutas,?developed?their?10?golden?rules?byturning?to?the?men?behind?that?philosophy—Aristotle,?Socrates,?Epictetus?and?Pythagoras,among?others.?The?first?rule—examine?your?life—is?the?common?thread?that?runs?through?theentire?book.?Soupios?says?that?it?is?based?on?Plato's?observation?that?the?unexamined?life?isnot?worth?living. "The?Greeks?are?always?concerned?about?boxing?themselves?in,?in?terms?ofconvictions?(信念),"?he?says. "So?take?a?step?back,?switch?off?the?automatic?pilot?and?actuallystop?and?reflect?about?things?like?our?priorities,?our?values,?and?our?relationships."
Stop?worrying?about?what?you?can?not?control
[D]?As?we?begin?to?examine?our?life,?Soupios?says,?we?come?to?Rule?No. 2:?Worry?only?aboutthings?that?you?can?control. "The?individual?who?promoted?this?idea?was?a?Stoic?philosopher.His?name?is?Epictetus,"?he?says. "And?what?the?Stoics?say?in?general?is?simply?this:?There?is?alarger?plan?in?life.?You?are?not?really?going?to?be?able?to?understand?all?of?the?dimensions?ofthis?plan.?You?are?not?going?to?be?able?to?control?the?dimensions?of?this?plan."
[E]?So,?Soupios?explains,?it?is?not?worth?it?to?waste?our?physical,?intellectual?and?spiritualenergy?worrying?about?things?that?are?beyond?our?control. "I?can?not?control?whether?or?not?Iwind?up?getting?the?disease?swine?flu,?for?example,"?he?says. "I?mean,?there?are?somecautious?steps?I?can?take,?but?ultimately?I?can?not?guarantee?myself?that.?So?what?Epictetuswould?say?is?sitting?at?home?worrying?about?that?would?be?wrong?and?wasteful?and?irrational.You?should?live?your?life?attempting?to?identify?and?control?those?things?which?you?cangenuinely?control."
Seek?true?pleasure
[F]?To?have?a?meaningful,?happy?life?we?need?friends.?But?according?to?Aristotle—a?student?ofPlato?and?teacher?of?Alexander?the?Great—most?relationships?don't?qualify?as?true?friendships. "Just?because?I?have?a?business?relationship?with?an?individual?and?I?can?profit?from?thatrelationship,?it?does?not?necessarily?mean?that?this?person?is?my?friend,"?Soupios?says. "Realfriendship?is?when?two?individuals?share?the?same?soul.?It?is?a?beautiful?and?uncharacteristicallypoetic?image?that?Aristotle?offers."
[G]?In?our?pursuit?of?the?good?life,?he?says,?it?is?important?to?seek?out?true?pleasures—advicewhich?was?originally?offered?by?Epicurus.?But?unlike?the?modern?definition?of?Epicureanism?as?alife?of?indulgence?(放纵)?and?luxury,?for?the?ancient?Greeks,?it?meant?finding?a?state?of?calm,peace?and?mental?ease.
[H] "This?was?the?highest?and?most?desirable?form?of?pleasure?and?happiness?for?the?ancientEpicureans,"?Soupios?says. "This?is?something?that?is?very?much?well-worth?considering?here?inthe?modern?era.?I?do?not?think?that?we?spend?nearly?enough?time?trying?to?concentrate?onachieving?a?sort?of?calmness,?a?sort?of?contentment?in?a?mental?and?spiritual?way,?whichwas?identified?by?these?people?as?the?highest?form?of?happiness?and?pleasure."
Do?good?to?others
[I]?Other?Golden?Rules?counsel?us?to?master?ourselves,?to?avoid?excess?and?not?to?be?aprosperous?(发迹的)?fool.?There?are?also?rules?dealing?with?interpersonal?relationships:?Be?aresponsible?human?being?and?do?not?do?evil?things?to?others.
[J] "This?is?Hesiod,?of?course,?a?younger?contemporary?poet,?we?believe,?with?Homer,"?Soupiossays. "Hesiod?offers?an?idea—which?you?very?often?find?in?some?of?the?world’s?great?religions,?inthe?Judeo-Christian?tradition?and?in?Islam?and?others—that?in?some?sense,?when?you?hurtanother?human?being,?you?hurt?yourself.?That?damaging?other?people?in?your?community?andin?your?life,?trashing?relationships,?results?in?a?kind?of?self-inflicted?(自己招致的)?spiritualwound."
[K]?Instead,?Soupios?says,?ancient?wisdom?urges?us?to?do?good.?Golden?Rule?No. 10?for?a?goodlife?is?that?kindness?toward?others?tends?to?be?rewarded.
[L] "This?is?Aesop,?the?fabulist?(寓言家),?the?man?of?these?charming?little?tales,?often?told?interms?of?animals?and?animal?relationships,"?he?says. "I?think?what?Aesop?was?suggesting?is?thatwhen?you?offer?a?good?turn?to?another?human?being,?one?can?hope?that?that?good?deed?willcome?back?and?sort?of?pay?a?profit?to?you,?the?doer?of?the?good?deed.?Even?if?there?is?noconcrete?benefit?paid?in?response?to?your?good?deed,?at?the?very?least,?the?doer?of?the?gooddeed?has?the?opportunity?to?enjoy?a?kind?of?spiritually?enlightened?moment.
[M]?Soupios?says?following?the?10?Golden?Rules?based?on?ancient?wisdom?can?guide?us?to?thepath?of?the?good?life?where?we?stop?living?as?onlookers?and?become?engaged?and?happierhuman?beings.?And?that,?he?notes,?is?a?life?worth?living.

Passage?One
Questions?46?to?50?are?based?on?the?following?passage.

Attitudes?toward?new?technologies?often?fall?along?generational?lines.?That?is,?generally,?youngerpeople?tend?to?outnumber?older?people?on?the?front?end?of?a?technological?shift.
It?is?not?always?the?case,?though.?When?you?look?at?attitudes?toward?driverless?cars,?theredoesn't?seem?to?be?a?clear?generational?divide.?The?public?overall?is?split?on?whether?they'dlike?to?use?a?driverless?car.?In?a?study?last?year,?of?all?people?surveyed, 48?percent?said?theywanted?to?ride?in?one,?while?50?percent?did?not.
The?fact?that?attitudes?toward?self-driving?cars?appear?to?be?so?steady?across?generationssuggests?how?transformative?the?shift?to?driverless?cars?could?be.?Not?everyone?wants?adriverless?car?now—and?no?one?can?get?one?yet—but?among?those?who?are?open?to?them,?everyage?group?is?similarly?engaged.
Actually,?this?isn't?surprising.?Whereas?older?generations?are?sometimes?reluctant?to?adoptnew?technologies,?driverless?cars?promise?real?value?to?these?age?groups?in?particular.?Olderadults,?especially?those?with?limited?mobility?or?difficulty?driving?on?their?own,?are?one?of?theclassic?use-cases?for?driverless?cars.
This?is?especially?interesting?when?you?consider?that?younger?people?are?generally?moreinterested?in?travel-related?technologies?than?older?ones.
When?it?comes?to?driverless?cars,?differences?in?attitude?are?more?pronounced?based?on?factorsnot?related?to?age.?College?graduates,?for?example,?are?particularly?interested?in?driverless?carscompared?with?those?who?have?less?education: 59?percent?of?college?graduates?said?they?wouldlike?to?use?a?driverless?car?compared?with?38?percent?of?those?with?a?high-school?diploma?orless.
Where?a?person?lives?matters,?too.?More?people?who?lived?in?cities?and?suburbs?said?they?wantedto?try?driverless?cars?than?those?who?lived?in?rural?areas.
While?there's?reason?to?believe?that?interest?in?self-driving?cars?is?going?up?across?the?board,?aperson's?age?will?have?little?to?do?with?how?self-driving?cars?can?become?mainstream.?Oncedriverless?cars?are?actually?available?for?sale,?the?early?adopters?will?be?the?people?who?canafford?to?buy?them.
46.?What?happens?when?a?new?technology?emerges?
A)?It?farther?widens?the?gap?between?the?old?and?the?young.
B)?It?often?leads?to?innovations?in?other?related?fields.
C)?It?contributes?greatly?to?the?advance?of?society?as?a?whole.
D)?It?usually?draws?different?reactions?from?different?age?groups.
47.?What?does?the?author?say?about?the?driverless?car?
A)?It?does?not?seem?to?create?a?generational?divide.

在山东省潍坊市，风筝不仅仅是玩具，而且还是这座城市文化的标志。潍坊以“风筝之都”而闻名，已有将近 2,400 年放飞风筝的历史。传说中国古代哲学家墨子用了三年时间在潍坊制作了世界上首个风筝，但放飞的第一天风筝就坠落并摔坏了。也有人相信风筝是中国古代木匠鲁班发明的。据说他的风筝用木头和竹子制作，飞了三天后才落地。

　　Stated-owned business or Joint venture
　　Upon graduation, virtually all college students will confront the problem of the career choice，which is truly a tough choice. Students' opinions differ greatly on this issue. Some hold that there is no better way to get a decent job than working in a stated-owned business which will guarantee my life after retirement, but others take the attitude that a joint venture outweighs any other jobs as it may provide higher income for employees.
　　As to myself, I prefer the latter view. A joint venture, especially a high-salary joint venture, exerts a tremendous fascination on a great number of people, with no exception to me. Although it might be impossible to make sure my retirement pension is good enough, high-salary is exactly what I need just now. In my view, our career choices largely depend on where we want to stay for the rest of life. For me, metropolis is the place where I can grasp loads of opportunities and achieve my personal dreams. As I hold the view that live in the moment, not the future, and also in order to finance myself in some aspects such as the transportation, the house-renting, or social activities, a joint venture can satisfy my needs for the consumption I mentioned above.
　　In short, a joint venture is the first and only consideration in my choice of career.

　　研究者搜集了150年的海洋温度数据， 目的是要清晰地比对现在与过去的变化趋势， 故不难推测出要做图来进行比对， 因此该空的答案为picture。

　　能与介词with搭配的形容词，通观所有的选项，只有combined，combined with意为结合， 该短语在句中做插入语。
　　Fossil fuel为矿物燃料，燃烧矿物燃料排放出的废气会导致温室效应， 故该空应该选择emissions。

短篇新闻2
　　Section A - 2
　　Rescue efforts were underway Thursday morning for 17 miners who were stuck in an elevator below ground at a Cargill rock salt mine near Lansing, New York, according to Marcia Lynch.
　　Public information officer with Tompkins County’s emergency response department, emergency workers have made contact with the miners via a radio. And they all appear to be uninjured, said Jessica Verfuss, the emergency department’s assistant director.
　　Crews have managed to provide heat packs and blankets to the miners so that they can keep warm during the rescue operation, Verfuss said. Details about what led to the workers’ being trapped in the elevator went immediately available. The mine, along New York’s Cayuga Lake, processes salt used for road treatment. It produces about 2 million tons of salt that is shipped to more than 1,500 places in the northeastern United States, the rock salt mine is one of three operated by Cargill with the other two in Louisiana and Ohio.
　　Q3. What does the news report say about the salt miners?

　　Section A - 3
　　The U.S. Postal Service announced today that it is considering closing about 3,700 post offices over the next year because of falling revenues.
　　Facing an $8.3 billion budget deficit this year, closing post officers is one of several proposals the Postal Service has put forth recently to cut costs. Last week, for example, Postmaster General Pat Donahoe announced plans to stop mail delivery on Saturdays, a move he says could save $3 billion annually.
　　“We are losing revenue as we speak,” Donahoe said. “We do not want taxpayer money. We want to be self-sufficient. So like any other business you have to make choices.”
　　Dean Granholm the vice president for delivery and post office operations said the first waves of closings would begin this fall. He estimated that about 3,000 postmasters, 500 station managers and between 500 and 1,000 postal clerks could lose their jobs.
　　Q5.What is the U.S. Postal Service planning to do?
　　Q6.What measure has been planned to save costs?
　　Q7.What will happen when the proposed measure come into effect?

　　Conversation 1
　　A: Mrs. Hampton, we've got trouble in the press room this morning.
　　B: Oh dear. What about?
　　A: One of the press operators arrived an hour and a half late.
　　B: But that's a straightforward affair. He will simply lose part of his pay. That's why we have a clock-in system.
　　A: But the point is the man was clocked-in at 8 o'clock. We have John standing by the time clock, and he swears he saw nothing irregular.
　　B: Is John reliable?
　　A: Yes, he is. That's why we chose him for the job.
　　B: Have you spoken to the man who was late?
　　A: Not yet. I thought I'd have a word with you first. He's a difficult man, and I think there's been some trouble on the shop floor. I've got a feeling that trade union representative is behind this. The manager told me that Jack Green's been very active around the shop the last few days.
　　B: Well, what do you want me to do?
　　A: I was wondering if you'd see Smith, the man who was late, because you are so much better at handling things like this.
　　B: Oh, alright. I'll see him. I must say I agree with you about there being bad feelings in the works. I've had the idea for some time that Jack Green's been busy stirring things up in connection with the latest wage claim. He's always trying to make trouble. Well, I'll get the manager to send Smith up here.
　　Q8. What will happen to the press operator who was late for the work according to the woman?
　　Q9. What does the man say about John who stands by the time clock?
　　Q10. Why does the man suggest the woman see the worker who was late?
　　Q11. What does the woman say about Jack Green?
　　Conversation 2
　　A: Our topic today is about somethings that foreigners nearly always say when they visit Britain. It's 'Why are the British so cold?' And they're talking about the British personality – the famous British 'reserve'. It means that we aren't very friendly, we aren't very open.
　　B: So do you think it's true?
　　A: It's a difficult one. So many people who visit Britain say it's difficult to make friends with British people. They say we're cold, reserved, unfriendly...
　　B: I think it's true. Look at Americans or Australians. They speak the same language, but they're much more open. And you see it when you travel, people - I mean strangers - speak to you on the street or on the train. British people seldom speak on the train. Or the bus. Not in London, anyway.
　　A: 'Not in London'. That's it. Capital cities are full of tourists and are never very friendly. People are different in other parts of the country.
　　B: Not completely. I met a woman once, an Italian. She's been working in Manchester for two years,
　　and no one - not one of her colleagues - had ever invited her to their home. They were friendly to her at work, but nothing else. She couldn't believe it. She said that would never happen in Italy.
　　A: You know what they say – 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. It’s really difficult to get inside.
　　B: Yeah. It's about being private. You go home to your house and your garden and you close the door. It's your place.
　　A: That's why the British don't like flats. They prefer to live in houses.
　　B: That’s true.
　　Q12. What do foreigners generally think of British people according to the woman?
　　Q13. What may British people typically do one the train according to the man?
　　Q14. What does the man say about the Italian woman working in Manchester?

　　Passage One
　　In college, time is scarce, and consequently, very precious. At the same time, expenses in college pile up surprisingly quickly. A part time job is a good way to balance costs while ensuring there is enough time left over for both academic subjects and after-class activities.
　　If you are a college student looking for a part time job, the best place to start your job search is right on campus. There are tons of on-campus job opportunities, and as a student, you’ll automatically be given hiring priority. Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time, and could be a great way to connect with academic and professional resources at your university. Check with your school’s career service or employment office for help to find a campus job. Of course, there are opportunities for part-time work off-campus, too. If you spend a little time digging for the right part time jobs, you’ll save yourself time when you find a job that leaves you with enough time to get your school work done, too. If you are a college student looking for work but worry you won’t have enough time to devote to academic subjects, consider working as a study hall or a library monitor. Responsibilities generally include supervising study spaces to ensure that a quiet atmosphere is maintained. It’s a pretty easy job, but one with lots of downtime-which means you will have plenty of time to catch up on reading, do homework or study for an exam.
　　Q16: What does the speaker say about college students applying for on-campus jobs?
　　Q17: What can students do to find a campus job according to the speaker?
　　Q18: What does the speaker say is a library monitor’s responsibility?
　　Passage Two
　　Agricultural workers in green tea fields near Mt. Kenya are gathering the tea leaves. It is beautiful to see. The rows of tea bushes are straight. All appears to be well. But the farmers who planted the bushes are worried. Nelson Kibara is one of them. He has been growing tea in the Kerugoya area for 40 years.
　　He says the prices this year have been so low that he has made almost no profit. He says he must grow different kinds of tea if he is to survive.
　　Mr. Kibara and hundreds of other farmers have been removing some of their tea bushes and planting a new kind of tea developed by the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya. Its leaves are purple and brown. When the tea is boiled, the drink has a purple color. Medical researchers have studied the health benefits of the new tea. They say it is healthier than green tea and could be sold for a price that is three to four times higher than the price of green tea.
　　But Mr. Kibara says he has not received a higher price for his purple tea crop.
　　He says the market for the tea is unstable and he is often forced to sell his purple tea for the same price as green tea leaves. He says there are not enough buyers willing to pay more for the purple tea.
　　Q19. Why have tea farmers in Kenya decided to grow purple tea?
　　Q20. What do researchers say about purple tea?
　　Q21. What does Mr. Kibara find about purple tea?
　　Passage Three
　　Today's consumers want beautiful handcrafted s to wear and to have for their home environment. They prefer something unique and they demand quality. Craftsmen today are meeting this demand. People and homes are showing great change as more and more unique handcrafted items become available. Handcrafts are big business. No long does a good craftsman have to work in a job he dislikes all day and then try to create at night. He has earned his professional status. He is now a respected member of society. Parts of the fun of being a craftsman is meeting other craftsmen. They love to share their ideas and materials and help others find markets for their work. Craftsmen have helped educate consumers to make wise choices. They help them become aware of design and technique. They help them relate their choice to its intended use. They often involve consumers in trying the craft themselves. When a group of craftsmen expends to include more members, a small craft organization is formed. Such an organization does a lot in training workshops in special media, craft marketing techniques, craft fairs and sales, festivals, TV appearances and demonstrations. State art councils help sponsor local arts and crafts festivals which draw crowds of tourist consumers. This boosts the local economy considerably because tourists not only buy crafts, but they also use the restaurants and hotels and other services of the area.
　　Q22. What does the speaker say about today's consumers?
　　Q23. What does the speaker say about a good craftsman in the past?
　　Q24. What do craftsmen help consumers do?
　　Q25. Why do state art councilshelp sponsor local arts and crafts festivals?

Part III Reading Comprehension (40 minutes)
　　Section A
　　26. E) challenge
　　空前主语为A new study，故此处应选一个动词第三人称单数作谓语，符合的词有E) challenges, M) suggests, 和 N) tastes，根据空后questioning，得出该空应填E) challenges 挑战，质疑。
　　27. J) searched
　　search for 为固定搭配，意为“寻找，搜索”，所给词汇中只有J) searched符合题意。
　　28. D) categorizing
　　空前是介词for，空后为名词brains，再根据后面的内容as “male” or “female”，初步判断该空应该填入动词的-ing形式。浏览选项，只有D)和H) 符合。根据搭配及语义，D)为答案，categorizing…as… 意为“把……分为……”。
　　29. K) similarities
　　根据空前的句子 “there are some gender-based…”，该空应填入名词复数形式。浏览选项，E), K), N)符合。再根据句意及空格后的句子“不同类型的大脑并不一直由性别区分”，该空应填入K) similarities “相似之处”。
　　30. L) slightly
　　空格前为be动词were，后为形容词different，很显然该空的词是来修饰different的，因此应填入副词。结合文意可知，虽然普通男性和普通女性的大脑差别很小，但是通过查看脑部扫描光片也没法对其进行区分。slightly为副词，意为“轻微地，稍微”，所以应填入L)。
　　31. G) percentage
　　空格前为形容词small，后为of people，因此应填入名词。结合文意可知，只有一小部分人具备“完全男性”或“完全女性”的特征。percentage意为“百分比”，a small percentage of…意为“一小部分”，所以应填入G)。
　　32. O) traditional
　　该空后为名词beliefs, 因此，该空应填入一个形容词，根据文意可知，很多研究都是在质疑“人们对于性别和大脑功能之间关系的传统理解”，因此，该处应选O) traditional传统的。
　　33. I)regardless
　　该空考查短语regardless of的含义。根据“他警告不要轻易给出以下结论：所有的大脑都是一样的，不论性别”可知，该空应填入I)regardless, 构成短语regardless of，意为“不管，不顾”。
　　34. H) proving
　　a mountain of evidence意为“大量的证据”，proving为现在分词作后置定语修饰evidence。
　　35. M) suggests
　　该句中，the study为主语，that引导的宾语从句作宾语，故此空应填入一个动词来作谓语，结合上下文，应选suggests，意为“暗示，表明”。
　　Section B
　　36. [I]对应关键词jamming attacks, 和equipment and skill在I段落中同时出现了两个关键词。
　　37. [D]对应关键词wireless security system, 和conversation在原文中有复现.
　　38. [J] 选项中wireless security system,和triggering the alarm可以在J选项中找到对应.
　　39. [F]SimpliSafe, 大写名词很好定位，在加上复现的distinguish，radio interference可以锁定选项F。
　　40. [B]根据small proportion可以确定唯一的选项B
　　41. [H]对应关键词keeps changing
　　42. [C]对应关键词transmit signals, 和activate.
　　43. [K]根据选项different measures只在K段落中出现了。
　　44. [G]选项cellphones是最关键的定位词，可以在G选项中找到复现。
　　45. [E]选项frequent对应了段落的frequency。
　　Section C
　　Passage One
　　46. [B] He intends to get rid of the tipping practice.
　　根据题目中的Bill Perry这个专有名词，我们可以定位到文中的第一段话。在But后面有提到“我能告诉你我喜欢这个小伙子。因为他打算禁止付小费这种情况，而赞成给服务员实际的工资”。B选项和这句话的含义接近，get rid of意为“摆脱”，和ban“禁止”含义相近;plan to和intend to含义一样。所以正确答案为B.
　　47. [C] It forces the customer to compensate the waiter.根据题干中的关键词the author hates tipping和main reason可以返回原文，定位到第三段。文中说“我讨厌它，因为它将义务伪装成一种选择。”既然是义务，那必然是强迫顾客去做的事情，这和C选项的含义较为接近。
　　48. [D] They can have some say in how much their servers earn.
　　根据关键词many people love tipping返回原文，我们可以定位至第四段。根据文中第二行的You like to feel that you have a voice in how much money your server makes.可知，这题应该选择D选项。
　　49. [A] Services quality has little effect on tip size.

翻译原文：在中国文化中，红色通常象征着好运、长寿和幸福，在春节和其他喜庆场合，红色到处可见。人们把现金作为礼物送给家人或亲密朋友时，通常放在红信封里。红色在中国流行的另一个原因是人们把它与中国革命和共产党相联系。然而，红色并不总是代表好运与快乐。因为从前死者的名字常用红色书写，用红墨水写中国人名被看成是一种冒犯行为。
　　参考译文：
　　The color of red in Chinese culture usually means good luck, longevity and happiness. Red can be found everywhere during Chinese Spring Festival and other joyous occasions. Cashes often in red envelopes are sent to family members or close friends as gifts. Its popularity can also be attributed the fact that people accociate it with Chinese revolution and Communist Party.
